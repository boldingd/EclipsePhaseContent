- I mispelled "Huygens" everywhere, because I'm an *idiot*.
  - Oh, actually I didn't.
  I just mispelled it on the first line of the notes.
  That's comforting.

Major Location: Endicott

    • AKA Cognite City.
    • A large “satellite” holding that Cognite maintains on Mars, for people who, for one reason or another, don’t want to be on Phobos.
        ◦ Cognite doesn’t own the dome; instead, they’re majority stakeholders in the consortium that does own the dome.
        ◦ Because they’re majority stakeholders, Cognite very effectively calls the shots.
    • The main habitable volume is an corporate-park-like environment, consisting of narrow “paths” between “buildings” underneath the terraced portion.
        ◦ They’re in quotes because most of the volume is the “buildings,” which are incorporated into the walls and supports.
        ◦ (i.e. “superstructure buildings”)
    • The city is “hourglass shaped”;
        ◦ it’s narrow at the center, but has two “lobes” to the northeast and southwest.
        ◦ The lobes are laid out like terraces.
        ◦ The lobes have sloped, smooth sides and flat tops, either covered in gravel or laid out like gardens and pavilions.
    • The city also has three (smaller) domes, with an angular design.  (I described them as “gem-cut style.”)
        ◦ They’re on each end of the hourglass, and a “city-center” dome is at the middle.
        ◦ The domes are elevated – they’re above ground level city, but below roof/terrace level.
        ◦ The “lobe-end” domes go right up to the edge; a cone-like portion is missing from the solar-panel fields, so each dome will have a view.
    • To repeat, Cognite doesn’t directly own the city; instead, it’s owned and operated by a holding company, that they have a largest-minority steak in.
        ◦ Because of this, they usually get their way, but they don’t completely control the city.
    • Endicott sits on the gentle slope that connects Syrtis Major Planum (highland) and Isidis Planitia (lowlands), both just north of the equator;
        ◦ just to the west of the green part of this picture.
        ◦ right in the middle of nowhere.
        ◦ Syrtis Major Planum is actually a shield volcano, just a really wide and low one (1° slope!). It’s also apparently dark and realtively dust-free.  It’s the first surface feature recorded on mars, by Christiaan Huygens!  It used to be called the Hourglass Sea.
    • Endicott has a population of 240K.
        ◦ Probably only 30k of those are directly employed by Cognite (or family and dependents), and maybe only another 50k are in subsidiaries employed directly by Cognite.
        ◦ The rest are support personal, people in related industries, and even sometimes competitors that need the same resources and talent.
    • Endicott controls much of the region’s important infrastructure.
        ◦ They’ve got a lot of life support capacity, a large fusion reactor, a massive field of solar panels, and the areas primary large communications spar.
        ◦ A major job for the HMAA is managing resource-sharing.
    • Endicott has some heavy communications gear pointed skyward, so they can have low-latency, high-bandwidth communication when Phobos is overhead.
        ◦ Among them is a big terrahertz link – although that’s diffused by water vapor and scattered by dust.  So, if you can see in terrahertz, you can tell the air quality when Phobos is overhead by looking for the beam.
    • Endicott was founded 15 years ago; the fact that the Ditch was already here was a factor.
        ◦ Let’s go with BF 4.

Major Location: The Polygons

    • Officially “the Polygon Steps”
    • Extropian “tower” about a kilometer northwest of Endicott.
    • It’s owned by a mutualist co-op, the Huygens Area Cooperative.
        ◦ Other Extropians work well; @-rep also spends here, although it’s a little tricky.
    • Laid out as a series of joined, irregular polygonal “steps”.
        ◦ Most of them are hexagonal.
        ◦ Each is topped with a “rock garden.”
        ◦ The sides are a dark retaining wall, with gravel lining them.
        ◦ The design is a little austere, but solid.  If the building was cheap to construct with local materials, it’s not poorly designed, built or maintained.
        ◦ It’s about 150m in “diameter,” and about 65, high at the center – the largest Hexagon.
        ◦ That’s higher than you might think, given the amount of gravel involved; all hail Mars’s low gravity.
    • It’s home to about 12k people.
    • The internal layout is a little complex – extropians are used to muse-assisted navigation.
        ◦ The superstructure and bulkheads follow the hexagon pattern, but several wide atria “blob” across levels and into neighboring “hexagons”.
        ◦ Infrastructure in the towers is distributed and redundant; they’re as much like several interconnected buildings (or a module habitat) as one structure.  They where designed to be easy to reconfigure, and to be fault tolerant – as one would expect from just-barely-pre-Fall construction.
    • It has its own small fusion reactor, as well as air and water systems;
        ◦ however, it’s also hooked into the HMAA exchange.
        ◦ It also has satellite uplinks, but it’s dependent on Endicott for long-range egocast-grade communications.
    • The Polygons have a large minifactury in one of the polygons – which is important because it’s major hard infrastructure that the Consortium doesn’t control.
    • (They are, strictly speaking, Tharsis citizens; they consider themselves Extropian Mutualist anarchists because they own the coop that owns the building.  The line between hypercorps and extropians is sometimes a little thin.)
    • The Polygons have a smaller solar panel field; they’re a more belter design, with lenses over the solar panels (which require cleaning in the dusty Martian atmosphere).  (Thanks, CV!)
    • The Polygons where constructed 12 years ago – just a year before the fall.  (So, BF 1 or so)
        ◦ That’s another reason they where designed to be easily expansible and cheap.
        ◦ They absorbed some infugees during the fall, but a good number of those have bled off to Endicott proper.

Major Location: The Ditch

    • The Argonaut burrow to the south.
    • The Ditch is laid out along a descending, narrow “canyon” or gully
        ◦ Structures are built into the walls.
        ◦ The middle portion is completely underground.
        ◦ I originally wrote that the middle portion was domed, but I told CV that it was underground and level.
        ◦ The layout of the smaller burrows along the canyon is haphazard; it was constructed without much planning 30 years ago, according to their ability to build (or bury) early-colonization prefab structures in the walls.
    • The Argonaut terraforming station is more than 30 years old, dating from early Mars colonization.
        ◦ It well predates Endicott – and is a large part of why Cognite chose the region.
        ◦ It’s also why Cognite (through Endicott city) doesn’t control the HMAA; they’ve never been able to completely wrest control from the Argonauts.
        ◦ Originally just called the Huygens Installation – the Argonauts are responsible for naming the region.
    • There are a bunch of smaller facilities, instruments, towers, and outbuildings scattered around on the surface.
        ◦ It’s also surrounded by solar panels (of a modern, “nano-tissue” construction, capable of growing, repairing and modifying themselves).
        ◦ It’s also surrounded not just by greenhouses and terraforming installations – but it’s close enough to the equator that liquid water sometimes exists here, and plant life has grown wide around the installation.
        ◦ So it’s surrounded by lichens, mosses, cacti, dandilions and Douglas firs (as per the book).
    • There isn’t much bare rock-face left in the sides of the canyon; over the decades, it was finished, and then, in many places, sculpted.
        ◦ It also features statues or mosaics, small artistic installations, and plants.
    • Like the Steps, it has its own small fusion reactor and communications facilities;
        ◦ being Argonauts, they actually have some fairly significant communications towers.
        ◦ But they’re still hooked into the Huygens Metro Exchange, and they’re dependent on Endicott for resleeving and body-banking.
    • It’s also recently grown some serious computing power,
        ◦ which may have surface heat-sinks.
    • The argonauts aren’t really trying to be a political faction – but, like Cognite owns Endicott, they own the Ditch.
    • The Ditch uses impressively modern solar panels, that use a chemical reaction (a la photosynthesis) and that grow (and are heliotropic).

Major Location: Gravel

    • Artlessly and literally named, the newest of the three installations.
        ◦ When a useful talent pool set up – and when it became obvious that Cognite wasn’t going to be able to take over the HMAA – Somatek decided to set up their own little city.
        ◦ It’s post-Fall; construction was completed almost three years ago.
    • It’s a city of about 23K.
    • It’s essentially a buried dome; form the surface, it’s just a wide, low mound of broken, crushed rock.
    • There are two sub-surface entrance ramps,
        ◦ leading to wide, high and sturdy vehicle airlocks, connected to large vehicle parks and loading bays.
    • It’s larger than the Polygons or the Ditch, but smaller than Endicott; it’s about 550m in diameter.
    • Like the other habs, it has its own infrastructure, but it also buys life-support and power from Endicott, through the Huygens Metropolitan Exchange.
    • It’s debatably beautiful, laid out like a lush, well-landscaped city—but it’s also haphazardly laid out.
        ◦ Buildings and structures run at differing levels, surrounded by irregularly-shaped plazas, green-spaces and ponds.
        ◦ There’s a dense, mostly-park region at the middle, and three “green-ways” that run to 12, 5 and 8 o’clock.
        ◦ I like the idea that it’s a little haphazard and chaotic—like there was a plan, but it’s breaking down.
        ◦ I also like the idea of a bunch of widely different buildings and architectural styles crammed up against each other.
    • There’s a fairly large non-human population – who are at risk because they don’t have full legal status on Mars.
        ◦ Although they’re treated fairly well in practice, because Somatek controls the city.
        ◦ Several uplift species have staked out one district or another of the city, which can lead to widely divergent and sometimes unusual architecture;
        ◦ of particular note are almost water-park-like constructions for neo-cetations.
    • Like Cognite with Endicott, Somatek doesn’t directly own the dome; instead, they set up a consortium to own and manage it, in which they are the largest stakeholders (at about 40%).
        ◦ Which means that Somatek very effectively calls the shots, but that they don’t directly run it and that there’s some wiggle-room.
        ◦ They do own a lushly landscaped and beautifully architected Somatek Campus between the 8 o’clock and 5 o’clock greenpaths.
    • The name “Gravel” was lazy and literal; it was built long after the Huygens Installation became the Ditch and the Huygens Cooperative Tower became the Steps.

Minor Location: the Metro-Area Seat

    • The Huygens Metro Area’s major holding.
    • it used to be in the Ditch, but it was moved to an area just outside the solar panels that surround Endicott (and also just outside Endicott Holdings’ property line).
    • No-one actually lives there; it’s basically a place where they stashed some capital that they didn’t want to put somewhere else – squad cars, ranger barracks, maintenance bots, some servers, and a secured area.
    • It isn’t like a county seat that’s designed to be visually appealing and show off the style of the municipality; it’s a government facility that’s meant to be durable, functional and secure.

Minor Location:  Huygens Regional Spaceport

    • HMAA’s other major project.
    • Basically some packed-gravel sub-orbital blast-off sites that are kept dust-free.
        ◦ (I think I’m going to assume that they get the first thousand feet under low thrust and then go full metallic-hydrogen-boost, so that they don’t need complex venting.)
    • The spaceport has the shiny new air-traffic control center (and some air-defense installations).
    • The blast-off pits are bermed, and all this is kept a good distance from the city – because an M-H rocket going up is violent.
    • They’re a few km to the south-east – a good, safe distance.
    • There’s a large (and unfinished) grippy-bot-building in the center that’s responsible for mating an egress ramp to the side of sub-orbital rockets.  It’s under construction; two arms are functional, two aren’t.
    • There’s also a parking lot for flying cars, and short runways for regional flights.
    • There’s also rows of large, cylindrical wind breaks to manage high winds of the Martian plains (and potential explosions).
    • A dirt road connects the spaceport to Endicott; there’s going to be a monorail, but it’s barely begun construction.
