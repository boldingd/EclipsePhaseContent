# Stealth

> I've GM'ed for a number of different groups, and stealth and infiltration are frequent pain points.
> Eclipse Phase holds out some pretty neat toys – terrahertz vision and active chamoflage, to name two – but then it places them in a very complex environment, where understanding how everything works, what technology defeats what sensors, and what is possible requires mastering a *lot* of information.
>
> It also doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining what "normal" is.
> The enhanced vision mod effectively defeats a *chameleon cloak*, because the chameleon cloak only works in visual wavelengths.
> So, in order to know if a chameleon cloak will let you sneak through a busy intersection, you have to have some idea of how likely it is that someone in the area will have enhanced vision, or that any of the security spimes will be trans-spectral imagers.
> The book tells us that these things are cheap, but it doesn't tell us how common they are; it's a call that the GM has to make, and chameleon cloaks might be *powerful*, *useful* or *useless*, based on the GM's (potentially arbitrary) judgement.
>
> Finally, it doesn't provide any real guidance to more mechanically-minded or descriptivist players about just what is possible, or how to do it.
>
> My goal is to write up how I've filled some of these gaps, in the hopes that it might be useful for other GMs.

We (\@anarcat and \@Bauble) have been in the organization for a while, and we've both been called in by other cells to help with difficult infiltrations that they don't have the local talent for.

## The Stakes

One of the first things to understand is what the consequences of failure are.
I've seen a hand-full of people fresh out of cold-storage who want to play out an interrogation scene from a noire.
"You ain't got nothing on me, copper!"

It doesn't work like that.
