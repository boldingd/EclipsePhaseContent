# Notes on Dirigibles

- [This site](https://www.airships.net/dirigible/) tells us the difference between various types of dirigibles.
  - "Dirigible" is the generic for any powered, steerable, lighter-than-air ship.  Whether they're rigid-framed or not.
- And [here's the wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship), for good measure.

- The [wikipedia for the upper atmosphere of Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus)
- And the Wikipedia for [corundum (i.e. sapphire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum) and [aluminum oxynitride, AKA "alon", maybe AKA transparent aluminum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxynitride)

- According to [this site](https://containertech.com/articles/container-load-capacity-weight-distribution), a 20\" shipping container can carry about 62,150lb.
  - Apparently container weight + carried weight equals about 67,200lb.
  - So that's 28,190kg of cargo per container.
  - So the airship in the book can't hold a full 20" container's worth of cargo.
- [Zeppelin NT](https://containertech.com/articles/container-load-capacity-weight-distribution) can apparently only lift 2,350kg.
  - It also has a top speed of about 125km/h.
- [LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_127_Graf_Zeppelin) had a "useful lift" of 87 tons.

## The Airship from the book

```
Passenger Airship (Aircraft)
A major method of intra-aerostat transport on Venus,
these huge vehicles are 250 meters long and 40 meters
in diameter and can carry up to 100 passengers and
20 tons of cargo. Powered by small fusion reactors,
these vehicles can operate for weeks at a time, but
most journeys take less than 5 days. [Expensive]
```

The passenger airship, and the small jet and flying car for comparison.
