# Notes on Dirigibles

- [This site](https://www.airships.net/dirigible/) tells us the difference between various types of dirigibles.
  - "Dirigible" is the generic for any powered, steerable, lighter-than-air ship.  Whether they're rigid-framed or not.
- And [here's the wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship), for good measure.

- The [wikipedia for the upper atmosphere of Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus)
- And the Wikipedia for [corundum (i.e. sapphire)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum) and [aluminum oxynitride, AKA "alon", maybe AKA transparent aluminum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxynitride)

- According to [this site](https://containertech.com/articles/container-load-capacity-weight-distribution), a 20\" shipping container can carry about 62,150lb.
  - Apparently container weight + carried weight equals about 67,200lb.
  - So that's 28,190kg of cargo per container.
  - So the airship in the book can't hold a full 20" container's worth of cargo.
- [Zeppelin NT](https://containertech.com/articles/container-load-capacity-weight-distribution) can apparently only lift 2,350kg.
  - It also has a top speed of about 125km/h.
- [LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_127_Graf_Zeppelin) had a "useful lift" of 87 tons.
