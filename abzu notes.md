# Abzu Notes

[Tentative name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu), to be replaced with something better.

## Sketch Overview

- Exo-world similar to a primordial earth.
  - Slightly larger (~1.1 r_earth?), less dense, slightly lower surface gravity (~0.8G?).
  - Roughly-primordial atmosphere; carbon still in the atmosphere as CO2.
    - Mix of CO2, oxygen, nitrogen, water, and traces.
  - Magnetosphere, so that lighter elements (c.f. hydrogen, water) won't get stripped away, and keeping surface radiation manageable.
  - Slightly smaller sun; Abzu's orbit is closer, but it's further out in the habitable zone.
    - Maybe call the star G4V.  I don't know anything about [stellar classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification): that's same luminocity as the sun, cooler, main-sequence.  The sun is G2V.
  - **Note**: haven't checked any of this.  One thing to *definitely* check is how bad that greenhouse effect would be, and what surface temperature and pressure we'd be looking at.
    - The planet definitely *is not* habitable without a vacsuit, but it shouldn't be so hellish that nomads and small towns don't make sense.
- Named for its primordial nature; life hasn't begun on the planet *yet*, but it should be easy to terraform.
  - The carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and water are all there; you just need some specialized organisms to integrate it into a biosphere.
- The world has not one but *two* known Pandora gates.
  - One of them is accessible (indirectly) from Mars, the other (also indirectly) from Oberon (i.e. the Fissure gate).
  - (Might want to add another one; might situate the two so they're... closer together than being on *opposite sides of the world*.  That makes contact between the two faction more likely, and leaves plenty of room for a potential third gate.)
  - The system also has at least one more gate: Extropians have established a colony on a moon around a gas giant.
    - Depending on the time we join the setting, they may not know it's the same system; radio contact will far precede a physical trip between worlds.
    - It might actually be *decades* before they have the kind of infrastructure that would make intra-system space travel feasible.
- Other minor locations, while we're at it:
  - Extropian colony (originally was thinking asteroid, then moon; now thinking gas giant)
  - Secured gate facility on the Pathfinder -> Abzu route.
  - Secured gate facility on the Fissure -> Abzu route.
- Proxy war between factions.
  - Major factions have better prospects; both the PC and Titanians have garden exoworlds, and TerraGenesis has started terraforming on... I forget the number I saw, but lots of worlds.
  - Plus, this one is *contested*: both the Inner and Outer Systems are here.
  - But it has the *potential* to be a future paradise, so they can't leave it uncontested.
  - So, essentially, each major faction is letting their B-teams and minor members fight it out, while backing their side.
  - So, a kind of proxy war.

## Some general gatecrashing notes

Gates:

- Vulcanoid gate (TerraGenesis)
  - Will work with anyone.
    - Ah.  TerraGenesis is a worker-owned cooperative.  Not based on Venus, though.  Have to look them up more.  I forgot about these guys, I may have to rewrite things.
    - Terragen has shifted to terraforming, and has work started on a bunch of currently-dead worlds.  Yeah, will need to do some rewrites.
  - Oh, cool.  [Vulcanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanoid) are theorized and have not been observed.  That's why I haven't heard of them.
    - They're hypothetical asteroids between 1km and 6km, inside the orbit of Mercury.  Probably hot enough to glow!
- Mars gate: Pathfinder
  - Pathfinder is a "direct subsidiary" of the Planetary Consortium.
- Pandora gate: gatekeeper
  - "on Saturn's moon Pandora".  I shouldn't known that.
  - IIRC, was a Titanian crown corporation, but they were pressured into separating interests.
    - Right.  It was a Titanian microcorp, converted into an independant hypercorp.  Titanians "are major but not controlling shareholders," and share ownership with a bunch of hypercorps, the PC itself, the Argonauts, and "nominally" some autonomist collectives.
    - So I guess "independent" should be in quotes.
- Fissure Gate: Love and Rage
  - "Located on Uranus' frozen moon Oberon"
- Discord Gate: the Ultimates
  - Located on Eris, which is a Kuiper Belt object.  (A "Dwarf planet" located "55 AU from the sun".)

## Factions

- Martian Hypercorporate
  - Martian hypercapitalism, with full-slavery indenture and all.
  - Private, hypercorp-owned settlement.
  - **Alignment**: Capitalists
- Martian Astra-Liberal
  - A bit like Venus, a group led by urban liberals and radicals.
  - Want to build a civil government first, hypercapitalist economy second.
  - Idea for a main conflict: get rid of inenture all-together?
    - Their version is run through their state, and less cruel -- but it's still indenture.
    - There's a movement to completely eliminate it.
  - **Alignment**: Capitalists
- Red-Necks
  - Small towns and settlements.
    - Problematic elements win "lotteries" and are chucked through the Pathfinder gate.
  - They serve a role a little like Extropians.  They're go-between for the settled capitalist city-states and autonomist-aligned Maker Nomads.
  - Capitalist by convention, but with no love of the oligarchs.  And previous connections to the Makers.
    - (Although remember that these guys are also probably earl space colonists -- so don't over-hick them.)
  - Basic idea: on Mars, they were part of the Movement, but they have no particular love of outer-system social experiments; they just want people to stop dropping comets on them.  And there are no comet drops on Abzu.
    - They like looking at a plot of land and saying "this is my land."  And they like getting paid for their work.
    - But they still have their close ties with the Makers, and other autonomists through the Movement.
  - **Alignment**: neutral
- Maker Nomads
  - A bit like the red-necks; problematic elements win "lotteries," and through the gate they go!
  - **Alignment**: Autonomists
- Lib-Socs
  - Need to name this hab.
  - Out-system Autonomists who went through the Fissure gate.
  - Organized along libertarian-socialist lines, a little like (my write-up of) Locus.
  - **Alignment**: Autonomists
- Mercurials
  - **Alignment**: Neutral
  - First, it was a small population of uplifted yeenas from Locus.
    - But then a large group from SomaTek decided to join them.
    - Others followed.
  - Some Mercurials have strong feels about *socio-economics*; some don't.
  - **Alignment**: neutral
- Ultimates
  - Come through the Discord gate.
  - Up to no good.  They are not building a city, they're building an encampment.
    - Other factions have probably noticed that they have no pretense of an *industrial base* -- which you'd expect, really.
    - Mainly military barracks and obstacle courses.
  - **Alignment**: Independent
- Extropians
  - I changed my mind a little, had a little brainwave, and/or just wanted to do this.
  - Extropian Mutualists / sub-culture weirdos.
    - Belt-Con approached L&R for access; they told them to sod off.
    - They set up a new mutualist coop to partner with, that was a little louder about their anti-property stance -- and/or threatened to sling rep and resources to make L&R's life difficult if they didn't bend a little.
    - Result: this tiny mutualist mining coop got to set up shop.
