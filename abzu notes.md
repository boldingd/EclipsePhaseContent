# Abzu Notes

[Tentative name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abzu), to be replaced with something better.

## Sketch Overview

- Exo-world similar to a primordial earth.
  - Slightly larger (~1.1 r_earth?), less dense, slightly lower surface gravity (~0.8G?).
  - Roughly-primordial atmosphere; carbon still in the atmosphere as CO2.
    - Mix of CO2, oxygen, nitrogen, water, and traces.
  - Magnetosphere, so that lighter elements (c.f. hydrogen, water) won't get stripped away, and keeping surface radiation manageable.
  - Slightly smaller sun; Abzu's orbit is closer, but it's further out in the habitable zone.
    - Maybe call the star G4V.  I don't know anything about [stellar classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification): that's same luminocity as the sun, cooler, main-sequence.  The sun is G2V.
  - **Note**: haven't checked any of this.  One thing to *definitely* check is how bad that greenhouse effect would be, and what surface temperature and pressure we'd be looking at.
    - The planet definitely *is not* habitable without a vacsuit, but it shouldn't be so hellish that nomads and small towns don't make sense.
- Named for its primordial nature; life hasn't begun on the planet *yet*, but it should be easy to terraform.
  - The carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and water are all there; you just need some specialized organisms to integrate it into a biosphere.
- The world has not one but *two* known Pandora gates.
  - One of them is accessible (indirectly) from Mars, the other (also indirectly) from Oberon (i.e. the Fissure gate).
  - (Might want to add another one; might situate the two so they're... closer together than being on *opposite sides of the world*.  That makes contact between the two faction more likely, and leaves plenty of room for a potential third gate.)
  - The system also has at least one more gate: Extropians have established a colony on a moon around a gas giant.
    - Depending on the time we join the setting, they may not know it's the same system; radio contact will far precede a physical trip between worlds.
    - It might actually be *decades* before they have the kind of infrastructure that would make intra-system space travel feasible.
- Other minor locations, while we're at it:
  - Extropian colony (originally was thinking asteroid, then moon; now thinking gas giant)
  - Secured gate facility on the Pathfinder -> Abzu route.
  - Secured gate facility on the Fissure -> Abzu route.
- Proxy war between factions.
  - Major factions have better prospects; both the PC and Titanians have garden exoworlds, and TerraGenesis has started terraforming on... I forget the number I saw, but lots of worlds.
  - Plus, this one is *contested*: both the Inner and Outer Systems are here.
  - But it has the *potential* to be a future paradise, so they can't leave it uncontested.
  - So, essentially, each major faction is letting their B-teams and minor members fight it out, while backing their side.
  - So, a kind of proxy war.

- I went through some of this with Claude.
- Turns out that ~20%-30% CO2 would have been completely hellish and unworkable.
- But ~3%-5% gets me where I want to go.
  - Surface temperatures between 30C-80C, depending on lattitude and season.
  - No haze; sulfur will get washed out, water vapor will still form clouds.
  - Still toxic, so some kind of protection is still required.
- Very importantly, still more than enough suspended carbon to build a biosphere.
  - Way *more* than is required, actually.
- Another minor note: the idea of an equatorial badlands.
  - It occurred to me since I wrote these notes, I think.
  - And it still works with the 3%-5% version.

## Some general gatecrashing notes

Gates:

- Vulcanoid gate (TerraGenesis)
  - Will work with anyone.
    - Ah.  TerraGenesis is a worker-owned cooperative.  Not based on Venus, though.  Have to look them up more.  I forgot about these guys, I may have to rewrite things.
    - Terragen has shifted to terraforming, and has work started on a bunch of currently-dead worlds.  Yeah, will need to do some rewrites.
  - Oh, cool.  [Vulcanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanoid) are theorized and have not been observed.  That's why I haven't heard of them.
    - They're hypothetical asteroids between 1km and 6km, inside the orbit of Mercury.  Probably hot enough to glow!
- Mars gate: Pathfinder
  - Pathfinder is a "direct subsidiary" of the Planetary Consortium.
- Pandora gate: gatekeeper
  - "on Saturn's moon Pandora".  I shouldn't known that.
  - IIRC, was a Titanian crown corporation, but they were pressured into separating interests.
    - Right.  It was a Titanian microcorp, converted into an independant hypercorp.  Titanians "are major but not controlling shareholders," and share ownership with a bunch of hypercorps, the PC itself, the Argonauts, and "nominally" some autonomist collectives.
    - So I guess "independent" should be in quotes.
- Fissure Gate: Love and Rage
  - "Located on Uranus' frozen moon Oberon"
- Discord Gate: the Ultimates
  - Located on Eris, which is a Kuiper Belt object.  (A "Dwarf planet" located "55 AU from the sun".)

## Factions

- Martian Hypercorporate
  - **Tentative Name**: [Bonaventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaventure_Plantation)
  - Martian hypercapitalism, with full-slavery indenture and all.
  - Private, hypercorp-owned settlement.
  - **Alignment**: Capitalists
  - **Combat Profile**: Substantial.  Air-superiority doctrine: sophisticated, stealthy combat drones and long range missiles -- or that's the eventual plan.  They may or may not be planning on wiping the Vanguard (and the rest of the autonomists) out.
- Martian Astra-Liberal / liberals
  - **Tentative Name**: Apsu Commonwealth or Apsu League
  - A bit like Venus, a group led by urban liberals and radicals.
  - Want to build a civil government first, hypercapitalist economy second.
  - Idea for a main conflict: get rid of inenture all-together?
    - Their version is run through their state, and less cruel -- but it's still indenture.
    - There's a movement to completely eliminate it.
  - **Alignment**: Capitalists
  - **Combat Profile**: policing.  Air-mobile cops and rangers.
- Red-Necks
  - Small towns and settlements.
    - Problematic elements win "lotteries" and are chucked through the Pathfinder gate.
  - They serve a role a little like Extropians.  They're go-between for the settled capitalist city-states and autonomist-aligned Maker Nomads.
  - Capitalist by convention, but with no love of the oligarchs.  And previous connections to the Makers.
    - (Although remember that these guys are also probably earl space colonists -- so don't over-hick them.)
  - Basic idea: on Mars, they were part of the Movement, but they have no particular love of outer-system social experiments; they just want people to stop dropping comets on them.  And there are no comet drops on Abzu.
    - They like looking at a plot of land and saying "this is my land."  And they like getting paid for their work.
    - But they still have their close ties with the Makers, and other autonomists through the Movement.
  - **Alignment**: neutral
  - **Combat Profile**: Minimal.  Armed individuals and ad-hoc organization.
- Maker Nomads
  - A bit like the red-necks; problematic elements win "lotteries," and through the gate they go!
  - **Alignment**: Autonomists
- Lib-Socs / autonomists
  - Need to name this hab.
  - Out-system Autonomists who went through the Fissure gate.
  - Organized along libertarian-socialist lines, a little like (my write-up of) Locus.
  - **Alignment**: Autonomists
  - **Habitat**: Initial habitat is 
  - **Combat Profile**: defensive, disorganized.  Militia drilling and asymmetric tactics; highly effective at making it unpleasant to hold their hab, almost useless against an opponent that just wants to kill them.
- Mercurials
  - First, it was a small population of uplifted yeenas from Locus.
    - But then a large group from SomaTek decided to join them.
    - Others followed.
  - Some Mercurials have strong feels about *socio-economics*; some don't.
  - **Alignment**: Neutral / Multiple
- Ultimates
  - Come through the Discord gate.
  - Up to no good.  They are not building a city, they're building an encampment.
    - Other factions have probably noticed that they have no pretense of an *industrial base* -- which you'd expect, really.
    - Mainly military barracks and obstacle courses.
  - Later addition: Nobody will admit to letting them through; very likely they have their own, third gate, reachable from the Discord gate.
  - Possible motivation/hook: they may not be able to get back.
    - This makes them a much more immediate threat to everyone else.
  - **Alignment**: Independent
  - **Population**: tiny (hundreds to thousands): a military outpost
  - **Combat Profile**: Significant.  Ultimate mercs in power aramor.  Large (~deer-sized) Loyal Squad Mate bots.
    - Notable lack of numbers, armor, or air power makes them a diminishing threat over time.
  - **Economic Profile**: negligable: just in-situ nanofabrication for military support.  They are not a growing society.
  - **Diplomatic Profile**: negligable: they hate almost everyone and almost everyone hates them.
- Extropians
  - I changed my mind a little, had a little brainwave, and/or just wanted to do this.
  - Extropian Mutualists / sub-culture weirdos.
    - Belt-Con approached L&R for access; they told them to sod off.
    - They set up a new mutualist coop to partner with, that was a little louder about their anti-property stance -- and/or threatened to sling rep and resources to make L&R's life difficult if they didn't bend a little.
    - Result: this tiny mutualist mining coop got to set up shop.
  - Addendum: they include some autonomist/outer-system members/minders.
    - They're there to keep the Mutualists on the autonomist straight and narrow.
  - They're not necessarily trying to build a grand colony; they're an (independant and self-sufficient) mining project.
    - They're making a beeline for Titanium deposits; they want to control the early supply of this vital metal.
    - They may also be setting up old-school steel works.  Because stainless steel will be valuable but expensive.
    - They're staying mobile.  They probably have a few mobile bases and mars buggies (or rough equivalents).  Their encampments are temporary -- temporary structures, open-air pit-fabs (basically big pits or above-ground tanks they throw resources and proteans in).
  - **Alignment**: Autonomist, Neutral
  - **Population**: tiny (hundred to thousands): caravan, mining and trading outposts.
  - **Combat Profile**: improvised, defensive.  Small, mobile seeker-carriers; survey drones outfitted with seekers; FPVs.
- Maoists / Vanguard
  - **Tentative name**: Apsu Vanguard
  - Maoists; authoritarian communists.
  - Originally/nominally circle-A, but plummeting @-rep and obvious abuses have led to them being largely blackballed.  L&R has specifically cut them off.
  - Out to violently overthrow Capitalism.
  - Demand surrender of resources to the fight; otherwise, you're an enemy.
  - Demand aid and support in the fight; otherwise, you're an enemy.
  - Use psychosurgery to enforce conformity in their habs.
  - Highly militarized.
  - Willing to fire seekers at people; have already fired at Mutualists to drive them off of claims.
  - **Alignment**: Autonomist
  - **Combat Profile**: Significant.  Three anti-drone beam-forming microwave vehicles; one also capable of serving as an AESA radar.  Working on blueprints for smaller carriers with similar capabilities (beamforming microwave weapons and AESA radaras).  Their own population, who are drilled and psychosurgically conditioned.  Small, somewhat-stealthy infiltration bot aimed at penetrating Bonaventure to compromise their control systems.

### Lower-Priority / Random Ideas

- Exhumans
  - Possibly give the "mercurial cluster" a little more heft and distinction.
  - *possibly* also came through the same gate as the Ultimates; may be related to why the Ultimates are stuck here, if I decide to go that route.
  - Hmmm!  They might also have egocast in from the Mutualist enclave on Blueblood Paradise, and have egocasted down.
    - I actually like that a lot more.
- Dynasty / Oligarchs
  - It's a stretch, but they're a decent faction and they'd liven up the place.

### Movements

- United Apsu
  - The U.N.!  A movement aiming to create an inter-faction organization to claim a monopoly on legitimate violence and eliminate inter-factional violence.
  - More appealing to liberals, autonomists, extropians; bonaventure and vanguard against; rednecks ambivalent.
- Criminals
  - probably a few got through, especially from Mars.
- Firewall
  - Mutualists were heavily compromised by Firewall; probably spreading out.

## Faction Layout

Quick though: faction (colonist, movement) / affinity layout

- Factions are either colonists (building some kind of independent settlement, like Bonaventure or Vanguard) or movements (having some kind of independent units / diplomacy / *outposts*, but no settlements; dependent on Colonists for support / influence)
  - In order to keep things simple, Ultimates and Mutualists are Factions -- they're not trying to build large, growing settlements with their own economies, but they do have *independent settlements*.  There is a map point you could attack.
- And they're grouped into *affinities*: Mercurials, Civics, Autonomists
  - these categories aren't mutually-exclusive.
  - ... actually, I just reinvented the rep networks, so we could just call it that.

- Tricky bit: if this were ever a game, movements would have weird win conditions.
  - UA wins if they get all -- or maybe just most -- factions to join.  (Peace for everyone, everyone wins.)
  - Criminals may win if they're deeply embedded in another faction that also wins.  (So, their win also isn't mutually-exclusive.)
  - Firewall may win if they still exist, someone else wins, and an x-risk never got out.
  - OK, so, that's the answer: it's not a one-winner kind of game, especially not when someone's playing a Movement.
  - *Maybe* you could also do a points-based thing.  Firewall wins if they stop enough x-risks; criminals win alone if they get rich enough; UA wins if they start building settlements under their own banner -- becoming colonists/a faction, rather than a movement -- and then win conventionally.

(I kind of like the idea that Firewall are goldfish-y / healer-y: they're playing their own game, and nobody notices them until they fail.
I also like that they'd keep people guessing: did Vanguard sabotage me, or did Firewwall?)

## Planet Notes

Talked to Gemma a bit.
Some quick notes:

- atmosphere
  - free oxygen is unlikely unless there's a process producing it.
    - Methane is more likely.
    - And so is water vapor -- surface water is fine?
    - Both of the above are also greenhouse gases.
  - So our final composition might look something like:
    - 87% Nitrogen
    - 3% CO2
    - 7% Methane (CH4)
    - Trace elements (Argon) and water vapor (variable)
  - *Weather systems* are probably more viable/impactful, especially around oceans.  Maybe very humid.
  - ~~50% surface water and cloud cover helps (it increases albedo)
- crust / surface
  -Lot of [basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt) on the surface.
    - Basalt apparently comprises most of the surface of venus.  It results from slow lava flows and is incredibly common.
    - Ah.  Per wikipedia:
      > Basalt generally has a composition of 45–52 wt% SiO2, 2–5 wt% total alkalis,[7] 0.5–2.0 wt% TiO2, 5–14 wt% FeO and 14 wt% or more Al2O3. Contents of CaO are commonly near 10 wt%, those of MgO commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt%.[54]
  - "Iron, silicone, aluminum, and other metals" will be abundant.
    - I think silicates (turns out, lotta rocks have SiO2) and good old rust can be efficient oxygen sinks.
  - Ocean may contain salts, dissolved minerals;
    - I haven't picked a salinity yet.
- Magnetosphere does imply a liquid core,
  - which implies vulcanism and earthquakes.
- Star: G4V (same class as Sol, a little cooler, still main-sequence)
- Orbit: *proportially a little further out than Earth*, yielding lower irradiance.  Still in habitable zone.
- Radius: 1.1r_earth
- Mass: less, leading to ~0.85G
