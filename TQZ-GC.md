# The Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative

> The Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative is an alternative player-character faction for Eclipse Phase, based off a group mentioned in the *Morph Recognition Guide*.
> 
> Many groups have trouble with the Panopticon (the open, ubiquitously-surveilled societies of Eclipse Phase), and the very high requirement for secrecy that it requires of a Firewall team; in my experience as a GM, groups can frequently spend much more time struggling with the implications of the panopticon than they spend resolving the mystery itself.
> 
> The goal in creating the TQZ-GC is to offer a faction similar to Firewall, that supports telling many of the same kinds of stories, but that relaxes the need for absolute secrecy and paranoia.
> (And maybe allows players to spend a little more time tromping around in battle armor with plasma guns, which players also seem to enjoy.)
>
> Obviously, it’s up to each individual group whether this to their taste, or whether it’s defeating the point of the setting.
> 
> Of course, the GC's should also provide useful allies and interesting additions to games set on Mars.

The Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative is a large, decentralized, peer-to-peer cooperative organized to help secure the border of the Titan Quarantine Zone; they are more commonly known as the G.C., with members often called either Guards or "gee-cees."
They operate all along the border of the TQZ, and their membership is drawn from all walks of Martian society.

They are an apolitical organization, believing (for the most part) that the job of securing the border and containing the TITAN threat is far too important to compromise for partisan gain.
Since they are organized as a peer-to-peer cooperative, they draw heavily from rednecks, anarchists, and other Movement-aligned groups; however, they do also have their prominent Tharsis League members and hypercorp partners, providing not only material and financial support, but also political cover and legal defense.

## Organization

Formally, every individual is an equal member of the organization; there are no ranks and there is no command structures.
Decisions are made by open discussions and votes of the entire membership, facilitated through their social network; the same network is used to track tasks, coordinate operations, keep records, track member feedback and status, and interact with the public.

Members are organized into *working groups*.
Working groups usually form around specific areas (for example, all the GCs in a specific city), tasks (for example, securing their network, or improving immunogenic systems), or organizations (for example, a specific team might organize themselves with a working-group).

Among other tasks, permanent working groups currently exist to maintain and secure the GC social network; to develop defenses against TITAN threats; to secure and distribute necessary military hardware; and to train members in the skills they need, since most volunteers do not have military training.

The Coop also partners with other organizations; they've worked with anarchist coops, small-town volunteer groups, Hypercorps, Argonaut teams, and more.
For example:

- some partner hypercorps provide political cover, legal support, and financial resources;
- some Argonaut organizations provide network security and operation, threat assessment and analysis, and nanophage updates; and
- some minifacturing groups and defense hypercorps provide military gear, vehicle refits, and other hardware.

## Operations

Actual TITAN break-out scenarios are rare: for whatever reason, TITAN war-machines rarely attack the Zone border directly.
Much more common are individuals or groups (ranging from hard-luck treasure hunters to well-funded hypercorp black ops) attempting to breach the Zone to recover valuable TITAN technologies.
Of course, this goes wrong far more often than it goes right — some might say that there’s no way for such a scenario to “go right" — and it frequently falls to the GC to investigate and thwart such efforts, and to contain the fall-out.
Smaller TITAN bots and plague-carrying wildlife can also cross the border; there’s always work to be done mopping up bot swarms and plague-carrying crawdiddies.

The GC is also called in to investigate unusual behavior that might be a sign of TITAN infiltration.
Sometimes towns, facilities or cliques can become suspicious or go dark entirely; when this happens, it often falls to the GC to investigate.
These investigations can be tricky, as suborned TITAN agents are extremely difficult to detect — not least because there are no generally reliable tests for infection, so it can be almost impossible to prove an individual (or town) is “clean.”
At the same time, if all suspected infections were treated as confirmed infections, there wouldn't be anyone left on Mars; it is a difficult balance to strike.
In the worse-case scenario, If it turns out that an outbreak is already underway, the GCs might be the ones who have to put a stop to it — an ugly, dangerous, stressful, and morally fraught process.

Sometimes the GCs have solid leads — specific threats identified at specific places — and their mission is the straight-forward elimination of the target.
More often, however, they get much more nebulous information — rumors, video snapshots, or curious trace evidence — and they have to infiltrate, investigate, and analyze to decide what has to be done.

Operations often come either from trusted partners or public reports.
Reports and aid-requests are submitted to the social network, and then passed to the members and working-groups in the best position to respond.
Of course, the Cooperative often receives more tips and requests than it can respond to.

## Public Status

Perhaps surprisingly for an anarchist-leaning cooperative, the Guard Coop operates publicly and openly.
They operate as transparently as they safely can.
They maintain extensive public records, and their debates and votes are held in the open on their social network.

Of course, not every mission can be reported, and not every working group follows procedures.
An operation against a Hypercorp black-ops team, for example, could never be safely reported; it would put the team involved at great risk.
So, most working groups keep off-the-books encrypted scratchpads, where they can stash information that they don’t want the public to become aware of.
This practice is discouraged, but remains widespread.

## Relations with Local Authorities

Formally, the Tharsis League opposes the Guard Cooperative, describing them (perhaps accurately) as paramilitary vigilantes operating openly in the Martian outback.
However, the GCs have the support of some powerful hypercorps and oligarchs; that, coupled with the fact that they have so far stayed away from the major domed cities of Mars, has kept the Tharsis League from seriously interfering in their operations.
Mars rangers, of course, vary widely: some generally support the GCs, some would be members if they could, some avoid them as often as possible, and some will shoot anyone with GC markings on sight.
(Of course, the GCs track and avoid the Rangers in the last group.)

Individual members are usually allowed to come and go freely in one of the “big four” domed cities on Mars, but local law enforcement will respond to GC operations as a threat.
As a policy, the GCs avoid operating in big cities, leaving their security to the Tharsis League and local authorities.

In the smaller cities and towns of the Martian outback, the situation can very widely.
It often depends heavily on the history that the local population has with the local working groups—and of course on the local elite’s opinion of the GCs.

The Guard Cooperative is well-respected on the circle-a network, and autonomist communities will often try to be helpful to members in good standing as they conduct official business.
Anyone is of course free to tell the GCs to sod off, but those that do can pay a heavy price in @-rep (even anarchists get nervous about a neighbor who has something to hide from TITAN-busters).

## Social Network

The GCs have little central infrastructure.
They use a block-chain-like structure to host their public data (including large parts of their social network), coupled with an encrypted, secured, distributed storage system used for more sensitive data.
Their secured network uses a complex system of rotating encryption and limited data replication to maintain data availability while minimizing the amount of data that a malicious actor could sniff (and crack) if a node was breached.
(This system is difficult to maintain; system maintenance and defense keeps more than one working group—and one Argonaut partner lab—busy.)

The network tracks reputations, civilian feedback, mission reports, votes, resource allocations, and public reports and tips.
Every individual member has an account, and each working group has a page and work-space.
Every member has a public key system set up as part of their account, so that they can cryptographically sign communications.

The public-key system also serves as a kind of credential; members can us it to verify their identities, both to other GCs and to any civilians that they might encounter.
This can be important: while the GCs have no formal authority, people are far more likely to cooperate with a high-rep member of the Guard Cooperative on an actual mission than they are with some random screaming person with a gun.
The network also allows public feedback; once people know a GC’s account name, they can also leave positive or negative feedback for that member.
The GCs as an organization know that they will only be able to operate as long as they are trusted by the public, so they tend to take negative feedback seriously.

## Example Members, Working Groups and Partners

### Union Labor

**Union Labor** is a working-group operating out of Batterville, a small town on the western slope of Olympus Mons.
They where founded by 6 members of a local construction firm; this included a retired Direct Action merc who was working as a security guard, and has provided most of their actual military experience.
They have since recruited a local mechanic, who has arranged for the group to have access to his company’s resources; this means that Union Labor has access to several heavy construction vehicles that have been militarized.
The group also includes a member of a local Argonaut terraforming initiative, who provides scientific and technical support.

### Nguyen, Basu, Williamson and Associates

**Nguyen, Basu, Williamson and Associates** is a powerful legal Hypercorp that is partnered with the GC’s, providing pro bono legal services.

Two of the partners, Basu and Williamson, each have assets totaling more than a billion credits; both can fairly be called oligarchs.
The pair also financially support the Guard Cooperative, and wield their considerable influence to protect the GC’s and their operations.

### Sufis

**Said al-Qarani** and **Hasan ibn Rashid** are Sufi nomads who have joined the Cooperative.
The two are members of a clan that travels the pocked and broken landscape to the South of Gale Crater, near the south-western extreme of the TQZ.

While the two tackle threats in their area of operations, their major service is in providing the Cooperative with intelligence from and access to the Sufi nomad community.
Sufi nomad communities are isolationist, and can pass very near the ‘Zone border; this means that they are both among the first who are likely to encounter a threat, and that they are at significant risk of infection themselves.
As such, the information that Said and Hasan can provide can be invaluable.

### Mayer Defense Technologies

Mayer Defense Technologies is a weapons manufacturing hypercorp based out of Noctis-Qianjiao that has partnered with the GCs; they provide top-dollar weapons to private customers, and including a number of defense hypercorps.

They provide licensed weapons to the GCs for free, on the condition that the GCs not disclose those blueprints to third-parties.
While many of the more anarchist-aligned GCs grumble, the value of having free blueprints for heavy military firepower is hard to argue.

They have occasionally performed manufacturing runs and provided customization services to groups operating near Noctis-Qianjiao; in one notable incident, they "militarized" a mars buggy for a group dealing with a TITAN bot-swarm operating south of Arsia Mons.

### Franz Roth Mueller

**Franz Roth Mueller** isn’t a member, but he is well-known to the Cooperative.
At turns both a respected professional academic and an antiquities broker, Mueller is comfortably wealthy and (mostly) professionally respected.

Mueller makes his home in an abandoned regional spaceport to the west of Elysium, which he’s turned into a veritable *compound*.
He’s offered shelter and support to more than one battered team limping away from an operation.
He’s also crossed paths with teams in the field; he’s an excellent marksman, and has a curious habit of showing up armed on the hunt for TITAN targets.

There is some discussion about why he hasn’t joined the organization.
The leading theory is that he’s unwilling to place GC missions ahead of either his academic career or his partner.

### Compromise Position

One of the shadier working-groups, **Compromise Position** are all enforcers for the Moderates criminal gang.
Well armed and accustomed to violence, they are highly effective.

As Moderates, they are primarily responsible for securing Moderate operations near Pathfinder City.
Being just south of the TQZ, this often involves putting down people running the zone border to infiltrate Qurain, who frequently carried TITAN plagues out of the Zone.
Eventually, they decided that they may as well join the GCs and get credit for their work.

Their reputation averages positive but fluctuates wildly; it is buoyed by their frequent combat operations, but drug down by their poor public perception, and especially by the fact that they are not above using their GC credentials to cover Moderate operations.
There is a building consensus that the cell needs to either reform — to stop abusing their credentials at the very least — or be removed from the organization.

Unsurprisingly, Compromise Position is frequently used as an argument against the GCs by their opponents.

### Reduction Working Group

The Reduction working-group is dedicated to making headway against the T.I.T.A.N. threat in the 'Zone — that is, to *reducing* the area covered by the TQZ.
Little material action can be taken without the cooperation of the Tharsis League, since the Zone border itself prevents any attack from without as well as from within; therefore, most of the working-group's product has been in planning, preparation, and politicing — wargaming out attacks, developing strategies that will destroy or remove the threat without spreading it; stockpiling (or *developing*) weapons specialized to the TITAN threat and the operations required; and attempting to persuade the public, the Tharsis League, and the oligarchs of the Consortium that gaining ground on the TITAN threat is a vital interest of transhumanity.

So far, the Tharsis League has been intransigent, seeminly content to contain the TITAN threat behind the border; however, public sentiment is turning against inaction, if slowly.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Hmmm, the Tharsis League has been intransigent?
> I wonder why.

> **Padre**: I support "reducing" the Zone, but I can tell one good arguments against it that I've heard: if we start shooting into the zone, than something inside the zone might decide to start shooting *back*.

> **Plasmage**: I feel like reprisal is only a problem if there's a major asset that survives a first strike.

## Rules

### GC Rep

The GC’s keep track of each member’s history with the organization, and use this to keep track of who is competent, who is trustworthy, and who is a gung-ho moron.
Mechanically, the GCs use their own rep network (GC-rep), and have their own networking field (Networking: GCs)

Anyone who has more than 30 GC Rep (and doesn’t have Black Mark or anything similar) may be assumed to be a member in good standing.

### The Trusted Member Trait (15 CP)

- Cost: 15 CP
- Requires: at least 10 GC rep, cannot have Black Mark: GCs or any similar trait

You are a trusted member of the TQZ Guard Cooperative.
This gives you member access to their social network, a vote in their governance, and access to their resources; however, it also commits you to contribute to the cooperative, if you want to maintain your standing.

The Cooperative resources that you have access to include:

- open-source TACNET software,
- open source and licensed blueprints for useful military hardware (rail rifles, seeker rifles, grenades, flamers, heavy combat armor and heavy helmets),
- open-source blueprints for useful upgrades (nanophages, medichines, immunogenic armor mods),
- open-source blueprints for useful survival gear (nanobandages, cold-weather clothing, standard vacsuits, specs and viewers), and
- physical examples of the above, if near a friendly minifacturing facility.

This also includes the necessary keys and software to both access the GC social network and verify your identity, and an Adjutant AI (see below).

### Honored Member Trait (15 CP)

- Cost: 15 CP
- Requires: at least 30 GC rep, cannot have Black Mark: GCs or any similar trait

You have been with the GCs for at least 6 months, you have been on at least 10 missions and you have scored at least one confirmed TITAN-asset kill.

Honored Members are rewarded with either a Fury or Reaper morph.

With your GM’s approval, you may pick another reward of roughly equal value: the GCs have access to some sophisticated military technology, often specialized to fight the TITANs, which they will happily offer to a recognized TITAN-buster who already has a morph that they like.

### Adjutants

Adjutants are specialized ALIs made available to all GCs.

Originally, Adjutants were simple agents designed to facilitate the correct and secure usage of the GC’s network; in the early days, non-tech-savy recruits often had trouble setting up the complex software that ran the GC’s network.
Over time, the GCs made the Adjutants more and more sophisticated; they also began to include other skills that they found that members frequently needed access to.

There are several different Adjutant packages available, with different code, written by a different group, and equipped with different skills.
A typical Adjutant might have the following skills:

- Infosec \[Defense\] 30
- Interfacing \[GC Network Software\] 40
- Protocol \[GCs\] 20
- Interest: TITAN technology 30
- Interest: Military Tactics 30
- Medicine: First Aid 30
- Medicine: Psychotherapy 30
- Profession: Military Training 40

## Secrets

### The GCs and Other Factions:

One might at first assume that the Guard Cooperative is a Firewall front; however, the exact opposite is true.
The GCs are far too public for Firewall’s taste, and so the agency has kept well clear of them; it is widely assumed that the Cooperative is heavily surveiled, and some of the most paranoid within Firewall even believe that the Guard Cooperative is just a honeypot set up by another intelligence agency, perhaps Project Ozma.

Ozma has not, in fact, thoroughly subverted the organization; the GCs are open enough that it would be difficult to do without getting caught, even for OZMA, and there’s also not much of a point because the GCs mostly do the work of keeping Mars safe(-ish) with no cost to the oligarchs running the Planetary Consortium.
Ozma has taken the basic step of surveilling the organization, in case they should need to sneak into the Zone without being caught, or on the off chance that a Firewall member or Titanian Fleet Intelligence operative should join.

Of course, Ozma's (and others') attempts at surveillance are opposed by the GC’s attempts at operational security; sometimes the GCs succeed, and sometimes Ozma does.

Oversight has a similar relationship: technically, the GCs are a large and well-armed organization outside of their direct control — but they’re also helping to keep the Zone secure without costing the Consortium anything, so why shut them down?
*Especially* as long as they scrupulously avoid making an enemy of the Consortium.

A small handful of Oversight agents have even quietly advanced the position that resources could be diverted to the GCs — exsurgent virus detection templates and updated immunological profiles if nothing else — so that they can continue to keep Mars secure for free.

The GCs are aware, of course, that at least one sophisticated actor is trying to penetrate their network and bug their operations.

### The Exsurgent Virus

The GCs know that the TITANS have produced some impressive nanological and biological weapons, and they know that these (nano-)plagues can infect, subvert and transform people—both biomorphs and synthmorphs.
However, they do not have the understanding of the Exsurgent virus that Firewall does; they don’t know that it’s one virus, thinking instead that a range of TITAN plagues, nanoswarms and bots are at work.

They also don’t know about Psi, chalking up reports of async phenomenon to advanced TITAN technology, confusion, and psychological stress on the part of witnesses.

And of course, they’ve never heard the term “Exsurgent Virus.”

## F.A.Q.

### So, if my character is a GC, do they need to run from Hypercorp personnel?

It depends, but probably not.

Some Hypercorp personnel regard every GC mission report as a confession to terrorism.
Those people are restrained by powerful people who support the GC’s mission, so normally they’re not much of a problem.

Otherwise, it depends on what your character’s done.
No-one would blame someone who lives near the Zone for carrying a gun, and no-one would criticize them for taking down a TITAN war-machine while they’re out there.
If, however, they also took down a Hypercorp black-ops team—or a rogue Argonaut, or a Barsoomian hiding in the Zone—then the dead person’s friends might come after that gun-toting vigilante (assuming they find out who that gun-toting vigilante is).

This is exactly why many GC workgroups don’t publicly report operations where a non-TITAN target gets killed.

### What about OZMA, do I need to run from OZMA?

Actually, for the most part, no.

You aren’t a member of a rival paramilitary intelligence agency with competing long-term goals.
All you want to do is ensure containment of the TQZ.
They have no reason to come after you.

Unless you’re also a Firewall agent, of course.
Or if they’re trying to run an op in the Zone *right now* and you're in their way.

### How big a deal is the GC's political-neutrality policy, really?

It's a pretty big deal.

They know that, if the Tharsis League (and/or the Planetary Consortium) decides to crack down on them, they're doomed.
All their operations are public — and even if they hid them now, it's a good bet that the Tharsis League has mirrors of the public part of their network.
So, if the League wanted to hunt them down, they'd have an easy time of it.
And even in a stand-up fight, they're badly overmatched by the League.

Beyond their own fate, a League crackdown would also defeat the mission; without them, the border would be *much* less secure, and that's ultimately likely to be a tragedy for all of Mars.

And, of course, they're presently getting important material support from certain Hypercorp interests.

For all these reasons, they take the political neutrality requirement *very* seriously.

Of course, this is meant to be role-played.
These kinds of moral dilemmas are a major feature of *Eclipse Phase*, and it can be very rewarding to see how your character deals with them.

And this also doesn't mean that your character can't have politics or values of their own; it just means that they can't use GC equipment or GC authority for non-Coop activites.
A Barsoomian freedom-fighter can still be a member in good standing, as long as they keep their affairs as a freedom-fighter well seperate from their operations as a Guard.

### Does my character get a badge?  Can I order people around?

Yes and no.

You do get a cryptographic signature that people can verify against the public portion of the GC’s rep network.
Which is the Eclipse Phase equivalent of “yes, you get a badge.”
(Note two things: they’ll need mesh access to verify your credentials; and, if they have mesh access, they can also see your GC rep and leave feedback on it.)

But, no, you can’t order people around.
You’re not part of a government agency.
But most people will be inclined to take you seriously if your GC rep is high when they check.
If a multiply-decorated volunteer TITAN-busting veteran says they need someone’s car, many people will let them use it — especially given that they can leave feedback on that person’s GC network profile after the fact.

This might even extend to law enforcement.
Most “good cops” operating near the TQZ regard the GCs — at least the high-rep ones — as partners of a sort.
(Unless a personal grudge or political conflict intervenes, of course.)

### So my character gets a shit ton of guns for free?

Yes they do!

The GCs want to make sure that TITAN busters are equipped to survive their mission, so they keep track of libraries of blueprints for the kinds of equipment that a member is likely to need.

However, remember that many of those blueprints are open-source; that means that they won’t work on fabbers that require that blueprints be signed, which is most (legal) fabbers on Mars and Venus.
(Of course, some quick infosec work can take care of that.)

Also remember that having an open-source bluep doesn’t mean that your equipment is legal for you to actually have in a given polity: the cops probably won’t let you wander around Elysium with a seeker launcher.

There is one final catch: some blueprints are actually commercial products provided to the GCs for free by hypercorp partners.
These people prefer that you not release those blueps to the public.
(And the other GCs will get real pissed at you if you do, because they want to keep getting new free gun blueprints from their hypercorp partners.)

### Wait, combat vehicle mods?  Can I have a technical?  A tank?

Maybe!
It depends on your GM.

Most working groups don’t have that level of firepower, but some do.
It depends in large part on if you have a local who can do that kind of work, and how close you are to a big city that would “frown upon” someone having a technical.
(Notably, some working groups that include construction crews use modified, up-armored construction equipment for heavy firepower.)

Of course, there aren’t rules for acquiring something like that, so you’d have to work that out with your GM (and get your GM’s permission, obviously).
And most of the caveats for the previous question also apply to someone who owns a tank.
