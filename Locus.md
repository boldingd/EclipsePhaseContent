Previous briefs on Locus have been pretty one-sided and also kind of shallow; I thought I'd try to correct both problems, going a little deeper into how Locus is organized, and casting a bit more of a critical eye.

I'm an Extropian Mutualist, so I think I can still offer at least a little bit of an insider's perspective — at least, relative to someone on Mars — while also being maybe a little less biased.

I'm also leaving commenting on; I may come to regret this.

## Libertarian Socialism

Locus's social organization is loosely inspired by libertarian socialism.
The occupants of the station reject both private property and state structures as illegitimate, oppressive hierarchies; they're trying to build a stateless, libertarian, socialist system.
("Libertarian" might be a bit of a loaded work here.
I mean "granting freedom to the individual," not "an-cap."
"Libertine" might be a better word.)

Their particular branch of libertarian socialist theory views flexibility as an advantage — basically, it's less a fleshed-out system, as much as it is a set of values and ideals, within which the cooperatives and people in a given area can *work out* their rules as needed.
(That's my first gripe about the other write-up: they act like Locus doesn't have rules or organization: it does.
Or, rather, the coops on it do.)

Some libertarian socialist thinkers envisioned a society structured around federations of worker cooperatives, and that's more-or-less how Locus works.
The station doesn't have an owner or an administrator, but it *is* dominated by a single, large federation of coops, the Locus Federation; and the federation pretty much structures their social/economic/political system.
And it does have rules.

Also, worth noting is that no-one owns the station itself.
The spars and cross-beams that make up the station, along with the rocks in the orbital neighborhood, are regarded as a commons — something owned by no-one, to be administered by the coops using and occupying it for the general benefit of everyone living there.

## The Locus Cooperative

Most of the population of Locus — a hair over 90% — are members of (coops that are members of) the Locus Federation.
The Federation is made up of worker co-ops, individuals, and smaller groups of the previous two.
The Federation isn't a government; it's a league of equals, and it pretty much exists just to maintain the social-credit economy.

At it's top level, its centered around the Locus Federation Exchanges, markets where the members (individuals and coops) exchange goods and products.
These exchanges are mediated by a local social-money, the Locus Federation Exchange Credit; most people call these ex-cred.

While members and coops have ex-cred balances, those don't actually determine what you can acquire; your current social score does that.
So, let's say I want to buy a piece of artwork that has a price of 80 ex-cred, but my current ex-cred balance is 5; what happens?
Well, the seller probably looks at my social credit score; if they like my history, and if my score is good, I get the sculpture; my ex-cred balance gets debited, and theirs gets credited.
My ex-cred balance just goes negative, and that's that — having a negative ex-cred balance doesn't do anything on its own.
If want to buy another statue, I potentially can; they'll probably check my social score, and if they still like me, my ex-cred balance will just go *more* negative.
My ex-cred balance doesn't determine what I can get, my social-credit score — my rep — does that.

>
> **anarcat**: Basically, it's for coordinating the economy.
> You'll see.

Ex-cred balances also decay to an equilibrium value over time, whether they're positive or negative.
(It's exponential decay with some extra terms; if you're curious, the whole thing is well-documented on the Locus Fed's mesh sites.)
In theory, this prevents people from getting sorted into an ex-cred-based economic hierarchy — wealth and debt both decay to "doing OK" over time.

Note that I said "equilibrium," not "zero."
The equilibrium value gets tuned by the Exchange, based on the state of the economy; it's usually a small positive value.
This has an effect *kind of* like a minimum income.

What your ex-cred balance *does* do is get factored into your social credit score, which the Locus Federation also maintains.
How much of an impact your ex-cred balance has depends on the state of the Locus "economy": loosely, during lean years, a negative ex-cred balance hurts you more, while during fat years, it hurts you less.
Early on, that math was pretty simple, keyed to the total size of the Locus market in ex-cred.
But, that made their economy go through roughly year-long growth-contraction cycles, so, they changed the way the math worked (and the new math, too, is extensively documented on their mesh site).

Finally, they also inject each ex-cred account with some special credits, called *Basic Resource Credits* — very roughly, these make sure that everyone always has access to a basic level of food, air, water, and power, without building up an ex-cred debt and no matter your social-credit score.

So, all together, your ex-cred balance *doesn't* determine what you can or can't buy, and it doesn't let you become fabulously wealthy or sink into debt; but it *does* allow the community to keep track of what it needs and what it doesn't, to keep track of who's doing useful work and who isn't, and to nudge the latter category into pitching in.
And they've also taken special care to make sure everyone can get food.

### Outsiders, Corner Cases, and FAQs

So, the Locus Federation runs all this, through the Locus Federation Exchange, their ex-creds, and the social-network score they give you.
But what happens if you're not a member of the Federation (or a member of a coop that is)?

Basically, you're completely outside the system, and on your own.
Individuals and coops may help you, or they may not; assume not.
Community makers will also ignore you, and you won't be able to draw resources.

On the up-side, though, joining the Federation is easy; basically, you just access their mesh and create an account in their system.
If you do, the system will assign you an ex-cred balance and social-credit score, and there you go.

What happens if you keep making accounts to game the system?
*Initially*, nothing; it's not *that* unusual for people to have multiple accounts.
Eventually, though, the admins in the Exchange will take steps to stop you — especially if they think you're doing it to game the system, as opposed to just wanting to keep your extreme kink-play off your main profile, for example.
Eventually, they'll lock you out of account-creation all-together.
(It's considered a sign of good intentions to link your different profiles on the Exchange — those links don't have to be publicly visible.)

OK, but can you go it on your own if you *want* too?
In fact, yes, you can; if just over 90% of the population of locus is in the Federation, the just under 10% *isn't*.
Some of these people may be members of smaller, self-sufficient cooperatives, and some of them may just be highly competent (or very well-supplied) individuals.

Well, what happens if you're a visitor?
Basically, you have a simple choice; create an account with the Locus Federation and join their social-credit economy, or don't.
If you create an account, you'll have an ex-cred balance and a social score just like everyone else does, and there you go; if you don't, you're on your own, hope you brought your own oxygen.

What happens if you build up a massive ex-cred debt, or otherwise trash your social-credit score?
Basically, you'll still be entitled to "baseline survival" resources — remember, every account periodically gets some Baseline Resource Credits.
But, after that, you're on your own; most people will shun you, and you'll get cycled to the back of basically every resource queue.
(Remember, the Locus Federation is a web of worker coops.
Basically anything you get is coming from one of those coops, and they're not going to give you a damned thing if your social credit score is crazy negative.)
Eventually, in theory, either you'll stop being an antisocial element, or you'll learn to enjoy living off gruel.

### Comparison

Ultimately, all this works well enough.
The price signal helps direct the Locus economy; it points people at useful work that needs doing, without allowing one group to gather all wealth to themselves and "exploit" the rest of society.
And Locus is a relatively egalitarian society: some people still have much higher ex-cred balances or social-credit scores than others, but in general, there's a much narrower gap between the best- and worst-off than on, say, Mars.
And it's self-sustaining; the Locus Federation's economy can support all of its members at a comfortable level.

On the other hand, the Locus economy is significantly less efficient and productive than basically any of the capitalist societies.
By pretty much any reasonable estimate, per-capita GDP is notably lower than Extropia, Venus, or Mars.
(If you try to assign a number in credits to the per-capita GDP of Locus, they'll yell at you, but it's still true that your average Loci has fewer resources available than your average Venusian.)

I should also say, many Locis will tell you that they're specifically trying to avoid resource depletion and over-consumption (and then launch into a frothing critique of "capitalist infinite growth").
I'll let the reader decide how they feel about that.

So, up to a point, it depends on how much value you put on hard egalitarianism, or having a society where it's incredibly hard to become either phenomenally rich or desperately poor.

## Justice

Here, in my opinion, is where things start to go bad.

I said before that the Locus Federation isn't a government, it's mainly just there to run the economy, right?
That means that, among other things, it *isn't* a criminal justice system.
The Locus Federation *can* serve as a forum for dispute resolution, and it will settle disputes between coops, but that's it; it doesn't have laws, or run a police force, or enforce social order, or have courts, or anything like that.

So how do law and justice work on Locus?

There isn't a formal system.

In the other write-up, the author just sort of flippantly asserts that crime just kind of doesn't happen among enlightened socialists.
It's true that, in an egalitarian society without poverty, there's certainly *less* crime — there basically are no crimes of poverty or desperation.
But the basic assertion is still bullshit.

Read the neighborhood mesh posts in any rich, well-off block on Mars, and you'll discover that safe, comfortable human beings can still find all manor of grudges, grievances, hates, and hurts to hold against one-another.
Old married couples on Earth would sometimes shoot each other in fights over the remote, and that kind of shit still happens on Locus.

So, how does Locus handle it?
For all the small things, there's rep-hits — and modules on Locus usually employ the same kinds of ubiquitous surveillance tech that habs do everywhere else, so being caught is likely.
You hate the stupid garish pink paint on the module next to you, so you break in and wreck up the place?
You were probably recorded, so you get some very negative feedback, your social credit goes down, you go to the back of resource queues, people treat you like an antisocial element, and ideally, you're shamed into not doing that again.

But what about major crime?
What if you carved a message into your neighbor while you where in their module taking out your frustration over their paint scheme?
Well, that starts out being between you and your neighbor — again, the occupants of Locus reject the idea of a state, even a communist one, so there isn't any law or law enforcement.

> **rategorytheory**: Really, really struggling to bite my tongue, here.

If you're both members of the same coop, it might get handled by whatever internal procedures that coop has.
Some coops have very reasonable internal conflict-resolution procedures; some do not.

Another "middle step" is gathering up a working group consisting of all your neighbors, and appealing to them to resolve the conflict.
Sometimes this works well, but it can also have all the problems you'd expect it to have — if "twenty random passers-by holding an impromptu court" doesn't sound like the start of an impartial legal system that carefully balances the interests of the accused and victim, that's because it generally isn't.

If you're in the Locus Federation, you can ask them to intervene.
They do, in fact, have a Justice working-group; basically, they review the situation and assign penalties as appropriate.
These can include rep-hits, restitution, and fabber restrictions; at worst, you get your accounts locked, and basically expelled from the Locus Federation.

There's a catch here, though, and it's a big one.
Notice that the worst thing that happens is that your account gets locked and you're on your own; that also means that the worst thing that happens *if your neighbor takes revenge on you* is that their account gets locked or they're on their own.
So, basically, the *real* worst-case scenario is that the person you victimize gets a few of their friends together and they come after you with their torturer's tools.

> **Bauble**: Right, sorry.

What that basically means is, sometimes Locus descends into some good old-fashioned blood-feuding.
This is pretty rare, but it *does* happen.
There are, in fact, at the time that I write this, three publicly-known ongoing feuds on Locus (there may be more that we simple aren't aware of).
The oldest one has been going on for nine years — that's right, it started before the Battle of Locus.
The main effect, for most of these, is that Parties A and B keep as far apart as possible most of the time — because everyone else on Locus regards getting in a gunfight as an antisocial behavior to be discouraged, and you'll take a rep-hit for it.

And, of course, the rest of Locus will basically just stay out of it, as long as they're kept out of the line of fire and no-one asks for help.
"We're not cops, so it's not our problem unless we get pulled into it," more or less.

Now, many Locis would tell you that, overall, crime and violence in their society is much rarer than on, say, Mars — and that's generally true — so the details of how their society handles crime don't really matter that much.
Some would also argue that their system, all things considered, still stacks up pretty well against the Martian or Jovian justice systems — and you know, I've never met someone outside the J.R. with a real positive view of *their* justice system, either.
Some Locis even take it as a point of pride — "have no fear sending your egocast to me, because if I fork-nap you and my neighbors find out, they'll pop my stack with a rusty spoon," to paraphrase one of the old Firewall guides.

Personally, I think that's *insane*.
But then again, I don't live on Locus.

## Society

The rest of the write-up on Locus is reasonably good.
The community is pretty progressive: AGIs and uplifts have person-hood, as will any other exotic and weird type of intelligence that comes along, probably.
The society is also fairly permissive: unlike some other fairly leftist outer-system social experiments, the Locis tend to have a fairly individualist-libertine viewpoint — their distaste for collective "hard power" and coercion wouldn't be out-of-place on an Extropian habitat, although I'm sure they're going to hate me for saying it.
Basically, you can be a bigoted shit if you want too; people won't like you and you'll loose rep for being a prick, but they won't space you or "reeducate" you.

The society is also pretty open and non-judgmental — maybe not as much as your average scum swarm, but still more than Venus and a lot more than the Jovian Republic.
You sleeve a critter and mod it to have dicks for fingers, and people will scowl at you, but they usually won't start screaming at you.
(And many of them have a certain flair for the eccentric; there's one Mercurial-aligned Loci who floats around in a giant stone head of Richard M. Stallman.
Locis get a kick out of it when "Stall-doz" flies up to a newcomer and vomits ectos on them.)

Somewhat like a Scum swarm or Extropian hab, consent is the main factor on Locus; there's not much that's forbidden, as long as everyone involved is a consenting (and competent) participant and you're not creating problems for anyone else.

That also goes for commodities.
Basically everything is legal on Locus, as long as it doesn't pose a large-scale threat to the station itself.
(Not that they have a system to actually detect and stop it.
And even then, if you're a well-heeled coop that people support, you can probably get away with it — as the "Toybox" cooperative does.)

Party drugs, weird morphs, lurid personal mods, and assault weapons; it's all allowed on Locus — although availability might be an issue, given their more sluggish economy.
And antisocial usages will get you rep hits, and a possible "collective reaction."

### Unrestricted Technology

And that brings us to probably the last thing I'd like to discuss: unrestricted technology, including but not limited to unrestricted nanofab.
