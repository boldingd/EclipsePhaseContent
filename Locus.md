Previous briefs on Locus have been pretty one-sided and also kind of shallow; I thought I'd try to correct both problems, going a little deeper into how Locus is organized, and casting a bit more of a critical eye.

I'm an Extropian Mutualist, so I think I can still offer at least a little bit of an insider's perspective — at least, relative to someone on Mars — while also being maybe a little less biased.

## Libertarian Socialism

Locus's social organization is loosely inspired by libertarian socialism.
The occupants of the station reject both private property and state structures as illegitimate, oppressive hierarchies; they're trying to build a stateless, libertarian, socialist system.
("Libertarian" is kind of a loaded word.
Here it means "granting freedom to the individual" more generally, not "an-cap.")

Their particular branch of libertarian socialist theory views flexibility as an advantage — basically, it's less a fleshed-out system, and more a set of values and ideals, within which the cooperatives and people in a given area can *work out* their rules as needed.
(That's my first gripe about the other write-up: they act like Locus doesn't have rules or organization: it does.
Or, rather, the co-ops on it do.)

The scheme used on Locus descends from a branch of libertarian socialist theory that envisioned a society organized around a stateless web of worker cooperatives; the station is an attempt to translate that idea into a system that works in an almost-post-scarcity "new economy."
The station doesn't have an owner or an administrator, but it *is* dominated by a single, large federation of co-ops, the Locus Federation; and the federation pretty much structures their social/economic/political system.

Also, worth noting is that no-one owns the station itself.
The spars and cross-beams that make up the station, along with the rocks in the orbital neighborhood, are regarded as a commons — something owned by no-one, to be administered by the co-ops using and occupying it for the general benefit of everyone living there.

## The Locus Cooperative

Most of the population of Locus — a hair over 90% — are members of (co-ops that are members of) the Locus Federation.
The Federation is made up of worker co-ops, individuals, and smaller groups of the previous two.
The Federation isn't a government; it's a league of equals, and it pretty much exists just to maintain the social-credit economy.

At it's top level, its centered around the Locus Federation Exchanges, markets where the members (individuals and co-ops) exchange goods and products.
These exchanges are mediated by a local social-money, the Locus Federation Exchange Credit; most people call these ex-cred.

While members and co-ops have ex-cred balances, those don't actually determine what you can acquire; your current social credit score does that.
So, let's say I want to buy a piece of artwork that has a price of 80 ex-cred, but my current ex-cred balance is 5; what happens?
Well, the seller probably looks at my social credit score, which includes my ex-cred balance and my social feedback history; if they like my history, and if my score is good, I get the sculpture; my ex-cred balance gets debited, and theirs gets credited.
To be clear, my ex-cred balance just goes negative; having a negative ex-cred balance doesn't do anything on its own.
If want to buy another statue, I potentially can; they'll probably check my social score, and if they still like me, I'll get another statue, and my ex-cred balance will just go *more* negative.
My ex-cred balance doesn't determine what I can and can't "afford," my social-credit score — my rep — does that.

> **rategorytheory**: If it doesn't do anything, what's it *for*?
>
> **anarcat**: Basically, it's for coordinating the economy.
> You'll see.

Ex-cred balances also decay to an equilibrium value over time, whether they're positive or negative.
(It's exponential decay with some extra terms; if you're curious, the whole thing is well-documented on the Locus Fed's mesh sites.)
In theory, this prevents people from getting sorted into an ex-cred-based economic hierarchy — wealth and debt both decay to "doing OK" over time.

Note that I said "equilibrium," not "zero."
The equilibrium value gets tuned by the Exchange, based on the state of the economy; it's usually a small positive value.
This has an effect *kind of* like a minimum income.

What your ex-cred balance *does* do is get factored into your social credit score, which the Locus Federation also maintains.
How much of an impact your ex-cred balance has depends on the state of the Locus "economy": loosely, during lean years, a negative ex-cred balance hurts you more, while during fat years, it hurts you less.
Early on, that math was pretty simple, keyed to the total size of the Locus market in ex-cred.
But, that made their economy go through roughly year-long growth-contraction cycles, so they changed the way the math worked (and the new math, too, is extensively documented on their mesh site).

Finally, they also inject each ex-cred account with some special credits, called *Basic Resource Credits* — very roughly, these make sure that everyone always has access to a basic level of food, air, water, and power, without building up an ex-cred debt and no matter your social-credit score.

So, all together, your ex-cred balance *doesn't* determine what you can or can't buy, and it doesn't let you become fabulously wealthy or sink into debt; but it *does* allow the community to keep track of what it needs and what it doesn't, to keep track of who's doing useful work and who isn't, and to nudge the latter category into pitching in.
And they've also taken special care to make sure everyone can get food.

### Outsiders, Corner Cases, and FAQs

So, the Locus Federation runs all this, through the Locus Federation Exchange, their ex-creds, and the social-network score they give you.
But what happens if you're not a member of the Federation (or a member of a co-op that is)?

Basically, you're completely outside the system, and on your own.
Individuals and co-ops may help you, or they may not; assume not.
Community makers will also ignore you, and you won't be able to draw resources.

On the up-side, though, joining the Federation is easy; basically, you just access their mesh and create an account in their system.
If you do, the system will assign you an ex-cred balance and social-credit score, and there you go.

What happens if you keep making accounts to game the system?
*Initially*, nothing; it's not *that* unusual for people to have multiple accounts.
Eventually, though, the admins in the Exchange will take steps to stop you — especially if they think you're doing it to game the system, as opposed to just wanting to keep your extreme kink-play off your main profile, for example.
Eventually, they'll lock you out of account-creation all-together.
(It's considered a sign of good intentions to link your different profiles on the Exchange — those links don't have to be publicly visible.)

OK, but can you go it on your own if you *want* too?
In fact, yes, you can; if just over 90% of the population of locus is in the Federation, then just under 10% *isn't*.
Some of these people may be members of smaller, self-sufficient cooperatives, and some of them may just be highly competent (or very well-supplied) individuals.

Well, what happens if you're a visitor?
Basically, you have a simple choice; create an account with the Locus Federation and join their social-credit economy, or don't.
If you create an account, you'll have an ex-cred balance and a social score just like everyone else does, and there you go; if you don't, you're on your own, hope you brought your own oxygen.

> **rategorytheory**: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but wait a minute: if you choose not to join the Locus Federation, you don't have a rep score, and they won't give you *oxygen*?

> But in their defense, I will say — I think I do say, actually — that "joining" the Locus Federation is pretty trivial.
> They don't require you to surrender all your property you own anywhere; they basically just require you to go by their rules in their habs.

What happens if you build up a massive ex-cred debt, or otherwise trash your social-credit score?
Basically, you'll still be entitled to "baseline survival" resources — remember, every account periodically gets some Baseline Resource Credits.
But, after that, you're on your own; most people will shun you, and you'll get cycled to the back of basically every resource queue.
(Remember, the Locus Federation is a web of worker co-ops.
Basically anything you get is coming from one of those co-ops, and they're not going to give you a damned thing if your social credit score is crazy negative.)
Eventually, in theory, either you'll stop being an antisocial element, or you'll learn to enjoy living off gruel.
Or you'll leave.

### Comparison

Ultimately, all this works well enough.
The Locus Exchange and its price signal help to direct the Locus economy: it points people at useful work that needs doing and nudges them towards doing it, without allowing one group to gather immense wealth to themselves or crushing the rest of society in debt.
And it does that without requiring a state structure or planning committee that might become an authoritarian force in their society.
And Locus is a relatively egalitarian society: some people still have much higher ex-cred balances or social-credit scores than others, but in general, there's a much narrower gap between the best- and worst-off than on, say, Mars.
And it's self-sustaining; the Locus Federation's economy can support all of its members at a comfortable level.

On the other hand, the Locus economy is significantly less efficient and productive than basically any of the capitalist societies.
By pretty much any reasonable estimate, per-capita GDP is notably lower than Extropia, Venus, or Mars.
If you try to assign a number in credits to the per-capita GDP of Locus, Locis will start yelling at you; you can, however, measure feed-stock, energy, and other resource-consumptions, and the Loci median is around two-thirds of the Venusian median, for example.

I should also say, many Locis will tell you that they're specifically trying to avoid resource depletion and over-consumption (and then launch into a frothing critique of "capitalist infinite growth").
I'll let the reader decide if they find that argument compelling.

Ultimately, your opinion of this economic system may come down to how much value you place on strong egalitarianism, or on having a society where it's very difficult to become desperately poor, versus how much you'd like a highly productive economy.
I don't think there's necessarily a right answer there.

> **anarcat**: I don't want to put this in the main text because it will turn this write-up into even more of a shit-show than it's already going to be, but I'm going to point out: rhetoric to the contrary, Locus is still a society that has haves and have-nots, only on Locus, it's determined by who can and cannot maintain a good reputation.
>
> Your current social credit score determines your access to resources (and other people's willingness to work with you), and your ability to make friends and influence people ends up having a profound impact on your social feedback and social credit score.
So "social-climber" types tend to have much better social-credit scores than other people, other factors notwithstanding; and, conversely, the awkward, shy, and introverted tend to struggle to keep a positive score.

## Justice

So, besides the economic model, Sentinels heading to Locus will need to know how the justice system works.
Here, in my opinion, is where things start to go bad.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Oh my god.
>
> **Bauble**: Hold on tight, it's gonna be a ride.

I said before that the Locus Federation isn't a government, it's mainly just there to run the economy, right?
That means that, among other things, the Federation doesn't have a criminal justice system.
The Locus Federation *can* serve as a forum for dispute resolution, mainly when they involve disputes between co-ops in the Federation, but that's it; it doesn't have laws, or run a police force, or enforce social order, or have courts, or anything like that.

So how do law and justice work on Locus?
Simply put, there isn't a formal system.

In the other write-up, the author just sort of flippantly asserts that crime just kind of doesn't happen among enlightened socialists.
It's true that, in an egalitarian society without poverty, there's certainly *less* crime — there basically are no crimes of poverty or desperation.
But the basic assertion is still bullshit: crime definitely still happens.

Read the neighborhood mesh posts in any rich, well-off block on Mars, and you'll discover that safe, comfortable human beings can still find all manner of grudges, grievances, hates, and hurts to hold against one-another.
There's the old meme about a married couple shooting each other in a fight over what to watch, and that kind of interpersonal shit still happens on Locus.

So, how does Locus handle it?
For all the small things, there's rep-hits — and modules on Locus usually employ the same kinds of ubiquitous surveillance tech that habs do everywhere else, so being caught is likely.
You hate the stupid eye-searing neon-green paint on the module next to you, so you break in and wreck up the place?
You were probably recorded, so you get some very negative feedback, your social credit goes down, you go to the back of resource queues, people treat you like an antisocial element, and ideally, you're shamed into not doing that again.

But what about major crime?
What if you carved a message into your neighbor while you where in their module taking out your frustration over their paint scheme?
Well, that starts out being between you and your neighbor — again, the occupants of Locus reject the idea of a state, even a communist one, so there isn't any law or law enforcement.

If you're both members of the same coop, it might get handled by whatever internal procedures that co-op has.
Some co-ops have very reasonable and sophisticated internal conflict-resolution procedures; some do not.

Another "middle step" is gathering up a working group — usually consisting of other involved parties, associates, and possibly volunteers from justice-related co-ops — and appealing to them to resolve the conflict.
Sometimes this works well, but it can also have all the problems you'd expect it to have — if "twenty random passers-by holding an impromptu court" doesn't sound like the start of an impartial legal system that carefully balances the interests of the victim and the accused, that's because it generally isn't.

If you're in the Locus Federation, you can ask them to intervene.
They do, in fact, have a Justice working-group; basically, they review the situation and assign penalties as appropriate.
These can include rep-hits, restitution, and at worst, suspension — basically, getting expelled from the Locus Federation.
(This doesn't mean getting physically thrown off the station, since it's an un-owned commons; this means getting locked out of the rep-economy, and loosing access to the co-ops in the Federation and the resources they produce.)

There's a catch here, though, and it's a big one.
Notice that the worst thing that happens is that your account gets locked and you get thrown out on your own; that also means that the worst thing that happens *to your neighbor* if your neighbor takes revenge on you is that *their* account gets locked and they're thrown out on their own.
So, basically, the *real* worst-case scenario is that the person you victimize gets a few of their friends together and they come after you with their torturer's tools.

This means that major conflicts can descend into some good old-fashioned blood-feuding.
This is pretty rare, but it *does* happen.
There are, in fact, at the time that I write this, three publicly-known ongoing feuds on Locus (and there may be more that we simply aren't aware of).
The oldest one has been going on for nine years — that's right, it started before the Battle of Locus.
The main effect, for most of these, is that Parties A and B keep as far apart as possible most of the time — because everyone else on Locus regards getting in a gunfight as an antisocial behavior to be discouraged, and rep-hits are applied appropriately.

Of course, the rest of Locus will basically just stay out of it, as long as they're kept out of the line of fire and no-one asks for help.
"We're not cops, so it's not our problem unless we get pulled into it," more or less.

Now, many Locis would tell you that, overall, crime and violence in their society is much rarer than on, say, Mars — and that's partly true — so the details of how their society handles crime don't really matter that much.
Some would also argue that their system, all things considered, still stacks up pretty well against the Martian or Jovian justice systems — and you know, I've never met someone outside the J.R. with a real positive view of *their* justice system, either.
Some Locis even take it as a point of pride — "have no fear sending your egocast to me, because if I fork-nap you and my neighbors find out, they'll pop my stack with a rusty spoon," to paraphrase one of the old Firewall guides.

Personally, I'm pretty skeptical; I think some rose-colored glasses are definitely involved.
And, more to the point, I think operatives heading to Locus should know how this system works.

## Society

The rest of the write-up on Locus is reasonably good.
The community is pretty progressive: AGIs and uplifts have person-hood, as will any other exotic and weird type of intelligence that comes along, probably.
The society is also fairly permissive: unlike some other fairly leftist outer-system social experiments, the Locis tend to have a fairly individualist-libertine viewpoint — their distaste for state power and coercion wouldn't be out-of-place on an Extropian habitat, although I'm sure they're going to hate me for saying it.
Basically, you can be a bigoted shit if you want to; people won't like you and you'll lose rep for being a prick, but they won't space you or "reeducate" you.

The society is also pretty open and non-judgmental — maybe not as much as your average scum swarm, but still more than Venus and a lot more than the Jovian Republic.
You sleeve a critter and mod it to have dicks for fingers, and people will scowl at you, but they usually won't *confront* you.
(And many of them have a certain flair for the eccentric; there's one Mercurial-aligned Loci who floats around in a giant stone head of Richard M. Stallman.
Locis get a kick out of it when "Stall-doz" flies up to a newcomer and vomits ectos on them.)

Somewhat like a Scum swarm or Extropian hab, consent is the main factor on Locus; there's not much that's forbidden, as long as everyone involved is a consenting (and competent) participant and you're not creating problems for anyone else.

That also goes for commodities.
Basically everything is legal on Locus, as long as it doesn't pose a large-scale threat to the station itself.
(Not that they have a system to actually detect and stop that.
And even then, if you're a well-heeled co-op that people support, you can probably get away with it — as the "Toybox" cooperative does.)

Party drugs, weird morphs, lurid personal mods, and assault weapons; it's all allowed on Locus — although availability might be an issue, given their more sluggish economy.
(Of course, antisocial usage will get you rep hits, and a possible "collective reaction.")

## Unrestricted Technology

And that brings us to probably the last thing I'd like to discuss: unrestricted technology, including but not limited to unrestricted nanofab.

This is one area where I differ with my fellow Extropians: I'm pretty skeptical of unrestricted nanofab.
I think the reasons why should be fairly obvious to everyone here: if you've been a Sentinel long enough, you've been in a situation where you've produced something with a hacked fabber that's done a lot of damage to someone's infrastructure.

So, I'm about to take a very dim view of the unrestricted tech environment on Locus, and I'm going to just go ahead and admit that it's hypocritical coming from an Extropian.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: I'll say it again, it's nice of you to just admit it.

They embrace unrestricted fab on Locus.
The conservative flanks of the Tharsis League — yes, the part that's also friendly with the hypercorps — like to scare the public with images of public cornucopia machines on Locus listing weapons on the print menu.
Well, that actually happens.
I'm not going to say "those are real," because, well, the Planetary Consortium — but public CMs on Locus will print you an assault rifle as readily as they'll print you a sandwich.
Their panopticon means that everyone around you can see that you're printing an assault rifle; I'll let you decide, in light of your own experiences as sentinels, if that's an adequate deterrent.

And it's not just light personal weapons: public fabbers won't have it on their menus, but, if you bring your own blueprints, they'll happily churn out seeker launchers, disassembler swarms, neurotoxins, and more devilish things.
And acquiring blueprints isn't much of a problem, especially if you have a decent social-credit score and know the right people.

Unrestricted fabrication isn't the only problem.
There's no real restrictions on technological tinkering or R&D.
*Boister's Armory* is a good example: blueprints available for… basically anything dangerous, including weapons capable of threatening ships and asteroids!

And There are other co-ops and individuals poking around other technological avenues.
People tinkering with bleeding-edge gene-modding, psychosurgical techniques, cognitive designs, self-sustaining nanotech, exotic reactors… all restrained only by "self-policing," rep-hits if you do something stupid (and either admit it or get caught), and the threat of retaliation if you screw up too badly.

I know, "the plural of anecdote isn't data," but just five weeks ago, one coop's hab-module got *digested* by a nanoswarm they where experimenting with and lost control of.
Fortunately, the outer hull and seals held, but as far as can be discerned, the swarm ate pretty much everything out to the hull; exothermically, too, it was hot in there.
The module was decoupled and chucked towards the inner system; it'll fall into the sun in something like a year and a half.

*After that*, rumors started to circulate that another co-op had gotten hold of this crazy, finely-etched silicate wafer, allegedly recovered from an exo-world.
People thought it was art, because it shone beautifully when light hit it; but then someone thought that the etchings might actually be some kind of *program*.
The damned fools started experimenting with different ways to interpret it, and actually tried *running* some of the executable versions!
They'd already had their systems go black-screen-full-fan *more than once* when *somebody* detonated a bunch of hell-balls in their module, taking care of that whole problem.
Hopefully.

And just for good measure, lest you think that blind hostility and factional animosity are unique to the inner system, just three days ago a vanguardist group managed to obliterate their own module and sever the spar they where attached to while developing new weapons to fight the Consortium.

Now, to be fair, a counter-argument is that Locus doesn't have the kind of economic or social organization to run the kind of big, black-budget labs that the Consortium sets up.
I don't think that's *entirely* true — there are plenty of decently-sized co-ops on Locus that have managed to fuck up in dangerous ways — but it is at least *partly* true in that most of those labs have lower access to resources, and there's relatively less motivation to engage in that kind of research.
So the threat coming from Locus is at least lower than the threat coming from the Consortium.
