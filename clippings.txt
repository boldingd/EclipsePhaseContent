Humble Beginnings is based on a particular hedonistic collective-anarchist philosophy; while the overall alliance exerts little control the member habitats, all are initially set-up using the Cooperative's anarchist scheme, and so far, all habitats have stuck with it.
The basic philosophy is similar to the Scum: essentially, "we have the resources and technology to live forever, and we have good enough automation that we don't need to work — so we should enjoy it."
It requires collective ownership of all capital, using a fairly expansive definition that allows little room for personal property; it also emphasizes ad-hoc social organization, using direct-democratic decision-making for major decisions or difficult conflicts and using 

Formally, the Humble Beginnings Collective is itself an alliance of individual cooperatives.
The Collective specifies some fundamental principles, such as collective ownership of capital, but does not otherwise define the social organization of each individual member cooperative.




Much like a Mutualist cooperative, the habitat, its major infrastructure, and many of its held resources are collectively owned, but "loaned" to members for productive use; their productive output is then exchanged on an open market.
However, their political system is also market-based, at least partially: much as individuals are given a fixed ammount disbursement of a local social money, they are also given a fixed disbursement of *political* currency.
Individuals can then spend *more* or *less* of their political currency when voting, to have a larger or smaller effect, correlating to their investment in any given issue.
