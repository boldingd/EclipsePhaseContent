# Dirigibles

## Overview

Venusian airships come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

## The Rules

The rules for dirigible construction are fairly simple.
The process proceeds in three steps:

- *optional*: pick the crew.
- pick the chassis.
- add hardware round-robin.

Oxygen is a less-efficient lifting gas than helium is on Earth, so a larger enclosure is required.
This means that, when designing dirigibles, weight is usually going to become a limiting factor *long* before space is.
For this reason, we are mainly only concerned with *weight*.

## Pick the Crew

- Normal Crew
- Firewall Cell
- Smugglers

## Pick the Chassis

Chassis vary.
For the most part, they're defined by:

- Hull material and structure type
- Size and weight capacity
- Fixed equipment

Most hulls will include *thrusters*, *life-support systems*, and *generators* in their fixed equipment.
If you pick a hull that doesn't, and then finish ship-construction without purchasing these components, then your ship probably won't be good for much.

### Hull Materials:

| Material | Structures | Sizes | Description |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Smart-Matter | Variable (Rigid, Semi-Rigid, or Non-Rigid) | Small, Medium, Large | The hull is made of smart-matter. |
| Tissue | Solid, Rigid, or Semi-rigid | Small, Medium, Large, Extreme | The hull is made of "tissues," composed of nanites, organic cells, or other elements |
| Solid | Solid | Large, Extreme | The hull is made of a solid material, like transparent aluminum or foamed metal. |
| Composite | Rigid, Semi-Rigid, or Non-Rigid | Small, Medium, Large | The hull is made of conventional (modern) materials, like fabrics or composites. |

#### Tissue

The dirigible's hull is made of various *tissues*, formed from nanites, biological cells, and similar components.
These hulls provide some of the benefits of smart-matter, in that they can grow, heal, and self-modify; however, they do so without requiring "active" nanotech meta-materials, and thus, can be significantly cheaper than smart-matter construction.
However, designing the genomes, programming, and behaviors of all the nanites and microorganisms involved can be exceptionally complicated -- it takes evolution millions of years to do, after all!

Nano-tissues can be rigid, non-rigid, or a mix of both.
Like Hamilton cylinders, they can embed control systems and other components in the hull as "organ systems" or "tissue layers"; this means that most tissue-construction hulls can be sleeved.
Tissue-construction hulls are also capable of growing and modifying themselves, without "hot" nanotech.

Tissue construction is included here for completeness, as no airship has been constructed from these materials -- at least, as far as is publicly known.

#### Smart Matter

Smart-matter consists, essentially, of a very dense nanoswarm, possibly suspended in some kind of supporting medium, and possibly with other elements present -- like energy stores or structural elements.
The nanites in smart-matter can link up with other nanites (or supporting elements), disconnect, move around, and perform other tasks.
At the macroscopic level, this creates a substance that can modify its physical properties on demand; this allows smart-matter a number of impressive capabilities, including the ability to reconfigure and repair itself.

Hulls made of smart-matter are light-weight and flexible, but also extremely durable, and can offer other benefits as well, depending on their composition and programming.
Most are self-adjusting and self-healing, and most can alter their color and texture; some can become transparent, function as displays, or provide active camouflage; some can rearrange themselves, changing the shape of the hull, creating internal rooms or floors, creating or sealing openings, and even forming or dissolving a rigid internal skeleton; some can produce useful features like furniture or hand-holds; some can become semi-permeable, allowing some objects or substances to pass through the hull while blocking others; some can form "pseudopods" or other appendages.
Much more is possible, given the right composition and programming.

However, gram-for-gram, smart-matter is also far-and-away the most expensive hull material in common use; because of this, it's rarely used on very large hulls.
It can also be particularly energy-inefficient, as it has to achieve its mechanical ends without the aid of large, specialized, energy-efficient structures like joints.
It also requires a continuous supply of energy and raw materials, as the nanites require a continuous supply of energy to operate, and they need to repair and replace themselves; somewhat like an organism, if smart-matter is deprived of energy and nutrients, it can effectively die.

#### Solid

Solid: the dirigible has a solid hull, possibly transparent aluminum or foamed metal.
While these hulls can be fairly tough, other flimsier hulls can be augmented with fixer swarms to achieve a similar practical level of durability.
Their major advantage is that, being rigid, they can resist deformation, and more effectively communicate force from the thrusters to the rest of the ship -- that is, essentially, they are capable of much higher speeds.

These hulls are usually *much* heavier than other types of hull; their greater mass means they require a much larger enclosed volume of gas, which in turn means that they are only practical with the largest airships.

Taking all these factors together, typically, only the largest, most-expensive dirigibles use solid hulls.

#### Composite

Composite: the dirigible's hull is made of a "traditional" material, like fabric.
This is far and away the cheapest construction; even so, modern fabrics can still be very light-weight and durable.
