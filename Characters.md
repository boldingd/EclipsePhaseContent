### DYTO

**DYTO** is an O.G. proxy.
He wasn't a founding member of Firewall, but he joined in the first year, and he's very well-connected.
He has expertise in bio-engineering, medecine, cognitive-science and psychosurgery – and can put them to terrifyingly effective use.
He's *very* techno-progressive Pragmatist, and very strongly believes that the transhuman factions need to stop fighting amongst themselves before they kill what's left of themselves.
He plays fast and loose with the rules, and recently caused a minor political crisis within Firewall; currently, he's had to accept some tough compromises to keep the peace in the organization.

### Plasmage

The **Plasmage** is a Proxy operating out of the wilds on Mars.
Notably, he served as a Sentinel for several years before becoming a proxy in his own right.

Plasmage holds advanced degrees in physics, biology and nanoscience, and has a strong hand at programming and infosec.
He should not, however, be assumed to be a helpless academic; he is an excellent shot with a plasma rifle, and has honed surprisingly effective combat skills in the Martian outback.
He also has connections with the Argonauts (obviously), Ecologists, and with the TQZ-GC — Firewall has a keep-your-distance policiy with respect to the Guard Coop, which has at least kept Plasmage from joining the organization, but has not kept him from cooperating with them.

Plasmage is also notable for his hard-core Pragmatist leanings.
Though he isn't a *particular* ally of his former proxy, he is connected to a number of eyes-only Pragmatist cells and projects.
He has also picked up his former proxy's habit of *bending* the rules, not least in that he has not abandoned "field work"; he still deploys with Sentinel sells.
While his many powerful talents make him an invaluable operative, a Proxy is also an extraordinary asset to risk in the field — more than a few of his peers have expressed the strong opinion that he should not be putting his unique knowledge and access at risk.

Rumor has it that the Ultimates do not particularly like Plasmage, owing to the fact that he allegedly made short work of a small team of Ultimate merceneries who had come to claim a member of his cell.
He is also reputed to have particular trouble when resleeving, being prone to strange habits for several hours afterwards — one story has him allegedly wandering corridors of an extropian hab completely naked, while continuously and compulsively eating chips from a maker.

> **Gunslinger**: I've got a Plasmage story.
> It involves his back-up screaming at us while his Exsurgent-infected body tried to kill us.
> He still jokes about that, "I told you to burn the body!"

### Anarcat

**Anarcat** is a jack of all trades, but a master of none; his most developed skills lie in engineering and infiltration, and he is currently serving a "technical support" roll in *@DYTO*'s cell.

Anarcat has, to a greater or lesser extent, cultivated a wide variety of skills: he has connections on circle-a, civic-net, and r-net; he is a competant freerunner, unarmed fighter, and infiltrator; he has a graduate degree in engineering, and good competency with related hardware and programming fields; and is trained as a "first responder" on his habitat, which includes a thin spattering of first-aid, militia, and damage-control training.
However, he has not particularly perfected any of these talents; he has most developed his engineering and infiltration skills, and has earned high marks on several missions for clever use of modded bots and for surprisingly cunning technologically-enabled infiltrations.

Somewhat controversially, Anarcat has been "withdrawn from field work" due to the objections of his partner.
This individual was never made aware of the details of Firewall — but, not being an idiot, could figure out that his Anarcat was involved in *something* unsavory.
*@DYTO* is something of a patron of Anarcat's, and decided to "reassign" him away from field work rather than have him leave the organization.
(Strictly speaking, Firewall does not work this way; however, when you have your router's support, and when your router has make-up-the-rules-level rep, you can do whatever he says you can do.)
Chester currently serves in a support role, providing bots and technology to other cells, and running or advising on long-running infiltrations.

> **Gunslinger**: Word is that he's gotten into Xyphos — maaaybe into the parts that the Ultimates really don't want you to see.

Open-minded — or perhaps non-commital — in everything, he regards himself as a cosmopolitcan 'Belter.
Although he is a member of an Extropian Mutualist community in 'Belt, he also maintains Titanian citizenship.

> **Gunslinger**: "Open-minded," hah.
> He's just a contrarian prick.
> You could show him the worst habitat full of the worst assholes, and he'd find something positive to say about them.
> And he'd find something negative to say about the Super Awesome Habitat of Eternal Peace and Love.

> **Padre**: I mean, there's something to be said for not having a black-and-white view of *everything*.

He is also active in Firewall's queer community, being bisexual (natch); and he has connections to the furry comminity (this has allegedly been useful in an operation).

### Bauble

**Bauble** is a *sentinel* in *@DYTO*'s cell; she's an accomplished smuggler, with ties to anarchist, criminal, and gatecrashing communities.
She has contacts (criminal and legitimate) throughout the system, including the belt, Mars, Luna, Venus and the outer system — notably including the Love and Rage collective.
Rumors have it that she comes from chinese lunar stock, and may have had connections with the Steel Liberators; and that she's recently been "on sabatical" after surviving a particularly harrowing series of missions, with sources variably placing her current location in Venusian orbit, in the Martian outback laying low in Movement-aligned scum, or on Carnival via the Rage Gate.

She's an accomplished smuggler, and has positive feedback from a number of teams operating in the inner and outer system, crediting her with getting things (and people) both into and out of habitats — by legal means and otherwise.
She is also well known in criminal, anarchist and gatecrashing communities, and can make those valuable social connections available to Firewall cells.
Bauble is also an expert glass-blower — a talent that can be surprisingly useful for Sentinels, as authentic hand-crafted art is always useful for a quick hit of rep or credits.

Bauble is noted for being cool in a crisis and particularly quick-witted, and has a unique talent for improvising her way through a crisis — a talent which may come in part from long practice, as she is also known for her disdain for planning and her tendency to launch herself into motion before she's entirely sure what she's going to do.

Bauble is also notable for being something of a skin-walker, experimenting with a wide variety of exotic sleeves, and for her quiet presence in Firewall's queer subgroup (as she is non-binary and asexual).
