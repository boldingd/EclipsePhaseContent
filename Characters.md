**DYTO** is an O.G. proxy.
He wasn't a founding member of Firewall, but he joined in the first year, and he's very well-connected.
He has expertise in bio-engineering, medecine, cognitive-science and psychosurgery â€“ and can put them to terrifyingly effective use.
He's *very* techno-progressive Pragmatist, and very strongly believes that the transhuman factions need to stop fighting amongst themselves before they kill what's left of themselves.
He plays fast and loose with the rules, and recently caused a minor political crisis within Firewall; currently, he's had to accept some tough compromises to keep the peace in the organization.
