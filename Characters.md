**Curé** is an O.G. proxy.
He was not, strictly speaking, a founding member of Firewall, but he joined the organization in its first year; he's been active and effective, and is very well-connected.
He has expertise in bio-engineering, medicine, cognitive-science and psychosurgery — and can put them to terrifyingly effective use.
Owing to his myriad of skills and connections, he became a proxy early.
He is a somewhat complex and divisive figure: while he has been highly effective as a proxy and has made a vital contribution to the organization, he has also played loosely with the rules — if not outright defied them — and has made some powerful enemies, especially among Conservatives.

Ideologically, he is very progressive, in both the traditional and technological senses: he is old enough that he remembers some of civil-rights struggles of Earth before the 'Belt was settled, and today he is a strong backer for morphological freedom, AGI and Uplift rights, and civil liberties in the solar system's more oppressive societies.
He also holds strong anti-factionalist and anti-conflict views: he believes that a great many cultures and societies are at least minimally valid, that many current factional conflicts are unjustified (or at least avoidable), and that inter-factional conflict is one of the greatest risks that the surviving transhuman remnant faces.

Unsurprisingly, he is a prominent figure in Firewall's Pragmatist faction.

As a Proxy, he plays fast and loose with the rules; this goes both for the internal dynamics of his cell, and for how he asses and responds to threats.
Unsurprisingly, many of Firewall's conservatives despise him; some even regard him as a threat.
(Conservative rumors allege that he has allowed ASI that he believe to be benign to escape Firewall operations; while no evidence has ever been produced, this has not helped his reputation among Firewall's conservatives.

Beyond his activities in Firewall, he is also an ardent anti-war activist; he very strongly believes that the transhuman factions need to stop fighting amongst themselves before what little remains of the transhuman community is destroyed.
Besides his activities as a Firewall proxy, he is also active in an anti-conflict dirty-tricks organization; organized somewhat like Firewall, he founded this organization after he failed to convince Firewall itself to adopt the view that inter-factional conflict was a major X-risk that they should act against.
The organization, though smaller, uses similar tactics to Firewall; they are not above the use of blackmail, assassination, and other, darker methods to avert major confrontations.
(Here again, there are rumors that he may have blurred the lines between Firewall and "Dove" operations, which also has not helped his reputation among organizational hard-lines.)

He has recently caused a minor political crisis within Firewall, owing to his recruitment of a highly-conservative agent who completely failed to acclimate either Curé's cell or the organization in general.
He's had to accept some tough compromises to keep the peace in the organization, and to maintain his status as a Proxy in good standing; among them, several of his agents have been rotated to other proxies, and he's agreed to keep certain moderate, high-rep Conservatives up-to-date on certain operating details in his cell.
He's also made more of a show of abiding by the organization's rules, at least in the medium term.

**Gunslinger** is a Sentinel originally recruited by \@Curé, who has since rotated through a handfull of other cells; he is currently on "detached assignment," coordinating with \@Plasmage and keeping an eye on the southeast edge of the Martian T.Q.Z.
Though Gunslinger is a remarkable shot with a long-rifle — as the name implies — he also brings an advanced degree in history; connections in several social circles; a smattering of survival, infiltration and social skills; and personal holdings and resources on Mars.

> **anarcat**: And, as the name also implies, he's obsessed with the Strugatsky brothers.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: REMOVE DUTY
>
> **anarcat**: And/or the Stalker games.

He's widely held to be fairly old, perhaps more than 80; it's believed that he travelled to Mars for his own reasons prior to the Fall; and that, having now spent several years outside of the conservative culture(s) of old Earth, he has, in of a fit of transhuman liberation, become something of a skinwalker and hedonist.

His (pre-fall) background was in academics (specifically history and preservation, having had an advanced degree and teaching position in the former), and his (post-fall) employement has been a mix of museum work and the "acquisition" of artifacts for the private market.
Notably, this gives him access to a wide network of social contacts, from respectable colleagues in Martian academia to the buyers and brokers of artefacts on the Guan-Xi; independantly, the personal wealth he's accrued has come with a certain degree of access to the "upper crust" of Mars, and his more hedonistic reincarnation (and left-leaning values) has earned him a positive reputation on Locus.
Impressively, he also has some presence in gatecrashing circles, and has provided his archaeological and preservationist expertise to first-in teams.

He is fairly left-leaning and quite transhumanist in general, and is strongly aligned with the Pragmatist block in Firewall's internal politics — though given his background and skillset, he is not widely believed to be actively involved in any particular pragmatist projects.

While his track-record is very good and his feedback tends to be positive, it is noted that he can be somewhat eccentric and more than a bit *tetchy*.
Care must be taken when he is placed on a team with either the particularly thin-skinned or the equally sharp.

### Plasmage

The **Plasmage** is a Proxy operating out of the wilds on Mars.
Notably, he served as a Sentinel for several years before becoming a proxy in his own right.

Plasmage holds advanced degrees in physics, biology and nanoscience, and has a strong hand at programming and infosec.
He should not, however, be assumed to be a helpless academic; he is an excellent shot with a plasma rifle, and has honed surprisingly effective combat skills in the Martian outback.
He also has connections with the Argonauts (obviously), Ecologists, and with the Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative — Firewall has a keep-your-distance policy with respect to the Guard Coop, which has at least kept Plasmage from joining the organization outright, but has not kept him from collaborating with them.

Plasmage is also notable for his hard-core Pragmatist leanings.
Though he isn't a *particular* ally of his former proxy \@Curé, he is connected to a number of eyes-only Pragmatist cells and projects.
(Analysis by Conservatives suggest that his and Curé's interests run along different lines, although those without need-to-know on several highly-restricted Pragmatist operations, it is impossible to determine what either of them are actually doing.)

He has also picked up his former proxy's habit of *bending* the rules, not least in that he has not abandoned "field work": he still deploys with Sentinel cells.
While his many powerful talents make him an invaluable and highly-effective operative, a Proxy is also an extraordinary asset to risk in the field — more than a few of his peers have expressed the strong opinion that he should not be putting his unique knowledge and access at risk.

> **Padre**: He's not just at risk from other factions.
> More than few of Firewall's conservatives would dearly like to know what he knows.
>
> **anarcat**: Ah, Firewall politics.
> Sometimes, we're our own greatest enemy.
>
> **Padre**: When the hard-core conservatives and hard-core pragmatists start shooting at each other, anyway.

Rumor has it that the Ultimates do not *particularly like* Plasmage, allegedly owing to a shoot-out between an Ultimate mercenary unit and the Plasmage and his cell (that the Plasmage won).
He is also reputed to have particular trouble when resleeving, being prone to strange habits for several hours afterwards — one story has him allegedly wandering the corridors of an extropian hab completely naked, while continuously and compulsively eating chips from a maker.

> **anarcat**: I can vouch for the first one.
> I was there — and not much use, owing to a nice bullet-hole in my morph.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: I've got a Plasmage story.
> It involves his back-up screaming at us while his Exsurgent-infected body tried to kill us.
> He still jokes about that, "I told you to burn the body!"
>
> **Bauble**: Are you going to actually tell us the story?
>
> **Gunslinger**: Need to know!
>
> **RategoryTheory**: Well then.

### Anarcat

| Anarcat |
| ------- |
| he/him |
| Languages | English (Native), Skandinaviska (Fluent), (Belgian) French (Basic) |
| Rank | Sentinel |
| Reputation | Good |
| Skills | engineering, infiltration, programming, needlers |

**Anarcat** is a jack of all trades, but a master of none; his most developed skills lie in engineering and infiltration, and he is currently serving a "technical support" roll in *@Curé*'s cell.

Anarcat has, to a greater or lesser extent, cultivated a wide variety of skills: he has connections on circle-a, civic-net, and r-net; he is a competent freerunner, unarmed fighter, and infiltrator; he has a graduate degree in engineering, and good competency with related hardware and programming fields; and is trained as a "first responder" on his habitat, which includes a thin spattering of first-aid, militia, and damage-control training.
However, he has not particularly perfected any of these talents — his most developed skills lie in engineering and infiltration.
These skills and a bit of craftyness, however, have been sufficient for him to make a valuable contribution on several missions, and he has earned high marks for the use of field-retrofitted bots and for technologically-enabled infiltrations.

Somewhat controversially, Anarcat has been "withdrawn from field work" by his router \@Curé, allegedly because of the objections of his (anarcat's) partner.
This individual was never made aware of the details of Firewall — but, not being an idiot, could figure out that Anarcat was involved in *something* unsavory.
Curé is something of a patron of Anarcat's, and decided to "reassign" him away from field work rather than have him leave the organization entirely.
(Strictly speaking, Firewall does not work this way; however, when you have your router's support, and when your router has make-up-the-rules-level rep, you can do whatever he says you can do.)

Anarcat currently serves in a support role, providing bots and technology to other cells, and running or advising on long-running infiltrations.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Word is that he's gotten into Xyphos — maaaybe into the parts that the Ultimates really don't want you to see.
>
> \[Message from @Bauble has been removed: violating need-to-know.\]

> **Plasmage**: lol

Open-minded — or perhaps non-committal — in everything, he regards himself as a cosmopolitan 'Belter.
Although he is a member of an Extropian Mutualist community in 'Belt, he spent his formative years on Venus, went to university on Titan, and still maintains Titanian citizenship.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: "Open-minded," hah.
> He's just a contrarian prick.
> You could show him the worst habitat full of the worst assholes, and he'd find something positive to say about them.
> And he'd find something negative to say about the Super Awesome Habitat of Eternal Peace and Love.
>
> **Padre**: I mean, there's something to be said for not having a black-and-white view of *everything*.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: The Jovian would stick up for him.

> **RategoryTheory**: Go fuck yourself, \@Gunslinger?
> Go fuck yourself.

> \[\@RategoryTheory has received a warning.\]
> \[\@Gunslinger has received a warning.\]

He is also active in Firewall's queer community, being bisexual (natch); and he has connections to the furry community (this has allegedly been useful in an operation, although the details of how this could possibly be the case are perhaps best not contemplated).

### Bauble

| Bauble |
| --- |
| flexible; she/her, or appropriate for morph |
| Languages | Mandarin (Native), English (Fluent) |
| Rank | Sentinel |
| Reputation | Good |
| Skills | smuggling, infiltration, (non-lethal) combat, fast-talking |

**Bauble** is a *sentinel* in *@Curé*'s cell; she's an accomplished smuggler, with ties to anarchist, criminal, and gatecrashing communities.
She has contacts (criminal and legitimate) throughout the system, including the belt, Mars, Luna, Venus and the outer system — notably including the Love and Rage collective.
Rumors have it that she comes from Chinese lunar stock, and may have had connections with the Steel Liberators; and that she's recently been "on sabbatical" after surviving a particularly harrowing series of missions, with sources variably placing her current location in Venusian orbit, in the Martian outback laying low in Movement-aligned scum, or on Carnival via the Rage Gate.

She's an accomplished smuggler, and has positive feedback from a number of teams operating in the inner and outer system, crediting her with getting operatives and material both into and out of mission theatre — by legal means and otherwise.
She is also well known in criminal, anarchist and gatecrashing communities, and can make those valuable social connections available to Firewall cells.
Bauble is also an expert glass-blower — a talent that can be surprisingly useful for Sentinels, as authentic hand-crafted art is always useful for a quick hit of rep or credits.

Bauble is noted for being cool in a crisis and particularly quick-witted, and has a unique talent for improvising her way through a crisis — a talent which may come in part from long practice, as she is also known for her disdain for planning and her tendency to launch herself into motion before she's entirely sure what she's going to do.

Bauble is also notable for being something of a skin-walker, experimenting with a wide variety of exotic sleeves, and for her quiet presence in Firewall's queer subgroup (as she is non-binary and asexual).

### Padre

The **Padre** is a proxy operating primarily out of the Jovian Republic.
He typically does not directly coordinate operations; he is mainly involved in gathering intelligence from within the Republic, and providing resources and support to teams that need to operate in Jovian space.

While the Padre leans conservative (unsurprisingly), he is known for his moderate temperament, for his surprisingly cosmopolitan outlook, and for his moderate political stance (in terms of Firewall's internal politics).
Notably, he is one of few solid Conservatives who still commands trust and respect in Pragmatist circles, and so he is an important peacemaker and trusted broker within the organization.

It is widely held that the Padre's name is literal — that he is in fact a priest or minister in some religious organization in the Jovian area.
The common theory is that he isn't Catholic — while Catholicism is far and away the majority religion of the Jovian Republic, it is neither the sole nor official religion there.
There are also communities from several other Christian denominations, of various Muslim and Jewish sects, and of non-Abrahamic religions.
In any case, one vital service the Padre provides is access to the subtle, unofficial chain of religious leaders and movements operating in the solar system — most prominently in the Jovian Republic, in the Muslim communities of Mars, and the Buddhist and Taoist communities on Luna.
(Some informally refer to this as "religion-net".)

> **anarcat**: Doesn't the fact that a bunch of wildly different religions all clustered into a peer-group kind of make them fungible in a way that suggests they're not real?

> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Fuck, I thought Richard Dawkins was dead.
>
> **bauble**: You just don't have a filter at all, do you?

> Well, not much of one.
