**Curé** is an O.G. proxy.
He was not, strictly speaking, a founding member of Firewall, but he joined the organization in its first year; he's been active and effective, and is very well-connected.
He has expertise in bio-engineering, medicine, cognitive-science and psychosurgery — and can put them to terrifyingly effective use.
Owing to his myriad of skills and connections, he became a proxy early.
He is a somewhat complex and divisive figure: while he has been highly effective as a proxy and has made a vital contribution to the organization, he has also played loosely with the rules — if not outright defied them — and has made some powerful enemies, especially among Conservatives.

Ideologically, he is very progressive, in both the traditional and technological senses: he is old enough that he remembers some of civil-rights struggles of Earth before the 'Belt was settled, and today he is a strong backer for morphological freedom, AGI and Uplift rights, and civil liberties in the solar system's more oppressive societies.
He also holds strong anti-factionalist and anti-conflict views: he believes that a great many cultures and societies are at least minimally valid, that many current factional conflicts are unjustified (or at least avoidable), and that inter-factional conflict is one of the greatest risks that the surviving transhuman remnant faces.

Unsurprisingly, he is a prominent figure in Firewall's Pragmatist faction.

As a Proxy, he plays fast and loose with the rules; this goes both for the internal dynamics of his cell, and for how he asses and responds to threats.
Unsurprisingly, many of Firewall's conservatives despise him; some even regard him as a threat.
(Conservative rumors allege that he has allowed ASI that he believe to be benign to escape Firewall operations; while no evidence has ever been produced, this has not helped his reputation among Firewall's conservatives.

Beyond his activities in Firewall, he is also an ardent anti-war activist; he very strongly believes that the transhuman factions need to stop fighting amongst themselves before what little remains of the transhuman community is destroyed.
Besides his activities as a Firewall proxy, he is also active in an anti-conflict dirty-tricks organization; organized somewhat like Firewall, he founded this organization after he failed to convince Firewall itself to adopt the view that inter-factional conflict was a major X-risk that they should act against.
The organization, though smaller, uses similar tactics to Firewall; they are not above the use of blackmail, assassination, and other, darker methods to avert major confrontations.
(Here again, there are rumors that he may have blurred the lines between Firewall and "Dove" operations, which also has not helped his reputation among organizational hard-lines.)

He has recently caused a minor political crisis within Firewall, owing to his recruitment of a highly-conservative agent who completely failed to acclimate either Curé's cell or the organization in general.
He's had to accept some tough compromises to keep the peace in the organization, and to maintain his status as a Proxy in good standing; among them, several of his agents have been rotated to other proxies, and he's agreed to keep certain moderate, high-rep Conservatives up-to-date on certain operating details in his cell.
He's also made more of a show of abiding by the organization's rules, at least in the medium term.

**RategoryTheory** is a *sentinel* active on Venus and Mars, skilled in infosec, programming, psychosurgery, and conventional psychology and psychotherapy.
She is also active in several civic and hypercapitalist social-networks; in particular, she has done a fair amount of freelance work for Cognite, and maintains contacts within the hypercorp.
(Cognite, of course, has been responsible for more than their fair share of Firewall operations, and points of access into the organization are few; this makes "Ratty's" contacts in Cognite highly valuable.)

She's also known for a particular center-line liberal political outlook, which puts her at odds with some of Firewall's more fiery autonomists; of course, the fact that she's an AGI wins her few friends among Firewall's most conservative flanks, which means that she can take fire from multiple fronts.
(By most accounts, she has more than enough fight in her for it.)

**Gunslinger** is a Sentinel originally recruited by \@Curé, who has since rotated through a handfull of other cells; he is currently on "detached assignment," coordinating with \@Plasmage and keeping an eye on the southeast edge of the Martian T.Q.Z.
Though Gunslinger is a remarkable shot with a long-rifle — as the name implies — he also brings an advanced degree in history; connections in several social circles; a smattering of survival, infiltration and social skills; and personal holdings and resources on Mars.

> **anarcat**: And, as the name also implies, he's obsessed with the Strugatsky brothers.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: REMOVE DUTY
>
> **anarcat**: And/or the Stalker games.

Like any Sentinel, the details of his identity are secret, but it's widely known that he's fairly old, in his 90's; that he travelled to Mars for his own reasons prior to the Fall; and that, having now spent several years outside of the conservative culture(s) of old Earth, he has, in of a fit of transhuman liberation, become something of a skinwalker and hedonist.

His (pre-fall) background was in academics (specifically history and preservation, having had an advanced degree and teaching position in the former), and his (post-fall) employement has been a mix of museum work and the "acquisition" of artifacts for the private market.
Notably, this gives him access to a wide network of social contacts, from respectable colleagues in Martian academia to the buyers and brokers of artefacts on the Guan-Xi; independantly, the personal wealth he's accrued has come with a certain degree of access to the "upper crust" of Martian society; and his more hedonistic reincarnation (and left-leaning values) has earned him a positive reputation in a number of autonomist communities, including Locus.
Impressively, he also has some presence in gatecrashing circles, and has provided his archaeological and preservationist expertise to first-in teams.

> **RategoryTheory**: So he's a real historian but also a looter, and he's an anarchist but also a rich Martian?

> **anarcat**: We've got us just a little mess of contradictions here, don't we?

> \[\@RategoryTheory has received a warning.\]
> \[\@anarcat has received a warning.\]
> \[\@Gunslinger\#MONOLITH has received a warning.\]

He is fairly left-leaning and quite transhumanist in general, and is strongly aligned with the Pragmatist block in Firewall's internal politics — though given his background and skillset, he is not widely believed to be actively involved in any particular pragmatist projects.

While his track-record is very good and his feedback tends to be positive, it is noted that he can be somewhat eccentric and more than a bit *tetchy*.
Care must be taken when he is placed on a team with either the particularly thin-skinned or the equally sharp-tongued.

### Plasmage

The **Plasmage** is a Proxy operating out of the wilds on Mars.
Notably, he served as a Sentinel for several years before becoming a proxy in his own right.

Plasmage holds advanced degrees in physics, biology and nanoscience, and has a strong hand at programming and infosec.
He should not, however, be assumed to be a helpless academic; he is an excellent shot with a plasma rifle, and has honed surprisingly effective combat skills in the Martian outback.
He also has connections with the Argonauts (obviously), Ecologists, and with the Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative — Firewall has a keep-your-distance policy with respect to the Guard Coop, which has at least kept Plasmage from joining the organization outright, but has not kept him from collaborating with them.

Plasmage is also notable for his hard-core Pragmatist leanings.
Though he isn't a *particular* ally of his former proxy \@Curé, he is connected to a number of eyes-only Pragmatist cells and projects.
(Analysis by Conservatives suggest that his and Curé's interests run along different lines, although those without need-to-know on several highly-restricted Pragmatist operations, it is impossible to determine what either of them are actually doing.)

He has also picked up his former proxy's habit of *bending* the rules, not least in that he has not abandoned "field work": he still deploys with Sentinel cells.
While his many powerful talents make him an invaluable and highly-effective operative, a Proxy is also an extraordinary asset to risk in the field — more than a few of his peers have expressed the strong opinion that he should not be putting his unique knowledge and access at risk.

> **Padre**: He's not just at risk from other factions.
> More than few of Firewall's conservatives would dearly like to know what he knows.
>
> **anarcat**: Ah, Firewall politics.
> Sometimes, we're our own greatest enemy.
>
> **Padre**: When the hard-core conservatives and hard-core pragmatists start shooting at each other, anyway.

Rumor has it that the Ultimates do not *particularly like* Plasmage, allegedly owing to a shoot-out between an Ultimate mercenary unit and the Plasmage and his cell (that the Plasmage won).
He is also reputed to have particular trouble when resleeving, being prone to strange habits for several hours afterwards — one story has him allegedly wandering the corridors of an extropian hab completely naked, while continuously and compulsively eating chips from a maker.

### Anarcat

| Tags | Unusual Ego |

**Anarcat** is a jack of all trades, but a master of none; his most developed skills lie in engineering and infiltration, and he is currently serving a "technical support" roll in *@Curé*'s cell.

Anarcat has, to a greater or lesser extent, cultivated a wide variety of skills: he has connections on circle-a, civic-net, and r-net; he is a competent freerunner, unarmed fighter, and infiltrator; he has a graduate degree in mechanical engineering, and good competency with related hardware and programming fields; and is trained as a "first responder" on his habitat, which includes a thin spattering of first-aid, militia, and damage-control training.
However, he has not particularly perfected any of these talents; his most developed skills lie in engineering and infiltration, and he often settled into those roles in his cell.
These skills and a bit of craftyness, however, have been sufficient for him to make a valuable contribution on several missions; he has good marks for field-retrofitting conventional bots, and for technologically-enabled infiltration.

Somewhat controversially, Anarcat has been "withdrawn from field work" by his router \@Curé, allegedly because of the objections of his (anarcat's) partner.
This individual was never made aware of the details of Firewall, but was able to determine that Anarcat was involved in something outside the law.
Curé is something of a patron of Anarcat's, and decided to "reassign" him away from field work rather than have him leave the organization entirely.
(Strictly speaking, Firewall does not work this way; however, when you have your router's support, and when your router has make-up-the-rules-level rep, you can do whatever he says you can do.)

Anarcat currently serves in a support role, providing bots and technology to other cells, and running or advising on long-running infiltration campaigns.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Word is that he's gotten into Xyphos — maaaybe into the parts that the Ultimates really don't want you to see.

> **Plasmage**: lol

Open-minded – or perhaps non-committal – in everything, he regards himself as a cosmopolitan 'Belter.
Although he is a member of an Extropian Mutualist community in 'Belt, he spent his formative years on Venus, and went to university on Titan – in fact, he still maintains Titanian citizenship.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: "Open-minded," hah.
> He's just a contrarian prick.
> You could show him the worst habitat full of the worst assholes, and he'd find something positive to say about them.
> And he'd find something negative to say about the Super Awesome Habitat of Eternal Peace and Love.

> **Padre**: I mean, there is something to be said for not having a black-and-white view of everything.

He is also active in Firewall's queer community, being bisexual (natch); and he has connections to the furry community (this has allegedly been useful in an operation, although the details of how this could possibly be the case are perhaps best not contemplated).

The **H0N-3** (pronounced "honey") is an AGI that almost grew up in the Organization; her cognitive-architecture was designed by a Sentinel (a Titanian, and also an AGI), who also raised her.
She adopted a number of her progenetor's causes, including his fierce opposition to the Jovian Republic and his commitment to Firewall, and was eventually recruited into the organization.
Also much like her progenitor, her approach tends to be "direct"; she tends to prefer hardy synthetic morphs, and brings a raft of combat skills to a mission.
She is also noted for having an innocent and empathic demeanor, and a certain amount of naivite about the material world.

While her skills have been invaluable to a number of teams and her reputation is good, her most recent deployment was something of a catastrophe, which has led to most members of her cell being stashed in various safehouses and hideouts until new identities can be forged.

### Bauble

| Tags | unusual ego |

**Bauble** is a *sentinel* in *\@Curé*'s cell; she's an accomplished smuggler, with ties to anarchist, criminal, and gatecrashing communities.
She has contacts (criminal and legitimate) throughout the system, including the belt, Mars, Luna, Venus and the outer system — notably including the Love and Rage collective.
Rumors have it that she comes from Chinese lunar stock, and may have had connections with the Steel Liberators; and that she's recently been "on sabbatical" after surviving a particularly harrowing series of missions, with sources variably placing her current location in Venusian orbit, in the Martian outback laying low in Movement-aligned scum, or on Carnival via the Rage Gate.

She's an accomplished smuggler, and has positive feedback from a number of teams operating in the inner and outer system, crediting her with getting operatives and material both into and out of mission theatre — by legal means and otherwise.
She is also well known in criminal, anarchist and gatecrashing communities, and can make those valuable social connections available to Firewall cells.
Bauble is also an expert glass-blower — a talent that can be surprisingly useful for Sentinels, as authentic hand-crafted art is always useful for a quick hit of rep or credits.

Bauble is noted for being cool in a crisis and particularly quick-witted, and has a unique talent for improvising her way through a crisis — a talent which may come in part from long practice, as she is also known for her disdain for planning and her tendency to launch herself into motion before she's entirely sure what she's going to do.

Bauble is also notable for being something of a skin-walker, experimenting with a wide variety of exotic sleeves, and for her quiet presence in Firewall's queer subgroup (as she is non-binary and asexual).

The **Padre** is a proxy operating primarily out of the Jovian Republic.
He typically does not directly coordinate operations; he is mainly involved in gathering intelligence from within the Republic, and providing resources and support to teams that need to operate in Jovian space.

While the Padre leans conservative (unsurprisingly), he is known for his moderate temperament, cosmopolitan outlook, and moderate stance on  Firewall's internal politics.
Notably, he is one of few solid Conservatives who still commands trust and respect in Pragmatist circles, and so he is an important peacemaker and trusted broker within the organization.

It is widely held that the Padre's name is literal — that he is in fact a priest or minister in some religious organization in the Jovian Republic.
The common theory is that he isn't Catholic — while Catholicism is far and away the majority religion of the Jovian Republic, it is neither the sole nor official religion there.
There are also communities from several other Christian denominations, of various Muslim and Jewish sects, and of non-Abrahamic religions.

In any case, another vital service the Padre provides is access to the subtle, unofficial chain of religious leaders and movements operating in the solar system — most prominently in the Jovian Republic, in the Muslim communities of Mars, and the Buddhist and Taoist communities on Luna.
(Some informally refer to this as "religion-net".)

> **anarcat**: Doesn't the fact that a bunch of wildly different religions all clustered into a peer-group kind of indicate that they're fungible in a way that suggests they're not real?

**BerkeleyMew** is a sentinel who operates in the Extropian belt with her partner \@Nautílos.
In an environment where the boundary between the legal and the criminal can be thin indeed, she works as a bounty-hunter, bodyguard, and enforcer.
She's cultivated a diverse array of skills and connections.
She is obviously a capable combatant, but also has some competency in social manipulation, interrogation, pursuit, and piloting.
She also provides access to a web of connection in both the Extropian and criminal networks.

A minor downside is a certain eccentric streak, including a predilection for bladed weapons; she prefers morphs that have enhanced strength and speed, in an attempt to make best use of her preferred weapons.
A certain amount of *nudging* is required to coax her into using conventional weapons and tactics.

Her overall feedback is strong; an operation on the slopes of Olympus was a particular highlight, where she earned high marks for adapting to the situation as it became *fluid*.

**Note**:  
You should probably set a nickname for this account, since it changes handles a lot.
It's original display-name was "8xAkimbo Raging Bulls", so he's commonly referred to as "Akimbo" or "RBs" in conversation.
You can use `[account-name:ID]`, where `ID` is this account's ID, to get the account's current display name; it will be rendered like this: *Cyrano de Bergerac's Pansexual Cephalopod Understudy*.
Within this wiki article, you can also use `[this]`, which will inject this article's current title (which should always be his display name).

Commonly called "Akimbo" or "RBs," *Cyrano de Bergerac's Pansexual Cephalopod Understudy* is a sentinel known for his effectiveness in combat and infiltration roles, and more recently for his support and advisory work.
He has an excellent track-record and good feedback; his only real demerits are a slightly irritable personal style and being more than a little gung-ho.

Being an octopus uplift, Akimbo prefers morphs that resemble his natural form and provide its advantages (and unique neural layout) — although experience has shown that he is perfectly capable of functioning in conventional humanoid morphs.

Akimbo was initially recruited by \@Curé and operated in his cell; however, for reasons restricted by need-to-know, he has since been moved to a safe-house and assigned to support operations.
In his current capacity, he has contributed to CASE:ENFIELD, a server developing libraries of useful fabber blueprints, and CASE:MELCHETT, a server providing training and support (and skillsofts) to teams who lack combat expertise.
(Unlike \@anarcat, Akimbo's current assignment is temporary; he will be returned to field work once the underlying issue has been resolved.)

**\/\/ No External Circulation; \/\/ Need-to-Know Only**

Akimbo's cover has been previously breached, by Experia of all things.
Current assessment is that someone in Akimbo's personal life figured out he was involved in some kind of vigilantism, tried to sell the story to the media, and did a particularly bad job of hiding his identity – not that it was going to help, given the kind of data-mining capabilities the Consortium has.
We pulled him out quick and scrubbed as much as we could, hopefully before someone in Ozma or Oversight figured out what they had.

Current balance of opinion is that this was not Akimbo's fault; this is just the risk we all take, as long as we still have personal lives.

The Neo-Octopus population is currently pretty small, and it's *very* hard to disguise an octopus ego as something else; this severely limits the number of places where he can conceivably be re-deployed.
If you've got a line on somewhere, send \@\*Akimbo or \@Curé a ping, or message the admins of CASE:MELCHETT.

0514NOMAD is a Sentinel known for her combat effectiveness; her academic background and skill as a sociologist; and her deep connections in the Martian outback, particularly in the Maker and Sufi Nomad communities.

While her feedback and track-record are good, her current access to i-net is limited, owing to her current situation: for the last 16 months, she has been traveling with a Scum swarm in the Martian outback, interacting heavily with Sufi nomads, and assisting the Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative.
Firewall has an official "hands-off" policy in regard to the latter group, as they operate in the open, and thus are almost certainly under active surveillance by other intelligence agencies.
(She hasn't been completely removed from Firewall for a number of reasons, among them her excellent track record, but also that our sources of intelligence on the Martian outback in general and the Sufi Nomad communities in specific are perilously few.
Her op-sec is generally good, so the consensus is that the risk is low.)

0514NOMAD is known for being *reserved* in her personal style, cool in a crisis, and professional.
Notably, owing to her experience with the organization and professional demeanor, she often falls into an unofficial "command" role in operations, and has also been a valuable guide and mentor for new and inexperienced Sentinels.

Operatives contacting her for aide or collaboration should be aware that she has a young daughter, and that this can introduce a certain amount of unavoidable logistical drag.
