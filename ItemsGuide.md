### Clever Bandit

The Clever Bandit is the result of a Firewall project to create an infiltration-focused biomorph.
This makes it both unusual (since infiltration, like combat, is often best handled by synthmorphs, or through indirect means) and rare (since Firewall obviously lacks the resources to produce a morph line at large scale).
The genetics and templates for the Clever Bandit are made available on the Eye – subject to demonstrable need-to-know, of course – and a few are kept ready near major population centers.

Within the Eye, the Clever Bandit is developed as a collaborative, open-source project.
The project's current maintainer is @tyrell, and discussion happens in a CASE: PRIMORDIAL CRAFT subgroup.
As a small, open-source project, several branches and forks have been created, and the project sometimes reflects the quirks and preferences of the maintainers more than any systematic analysis of Sentinels' needs.

**\/\/ Need-to-Know Only: Asyncs**

The morph was created to cater to async infiltrators, so extensive work has gone into the biological portions of the morph's brain.
Unlike most other pods, more than half of the original raccoon brain has been kept intact – notably including the portions of the somatosensory cortex that process the raccoons unique sense of touch.
Beyond preserving the raccoon's exceptional sense of touch, this extra nervous tissue makes the use of "sleights" significantly easier and more effective than would normally be the case.

Keeping so much of the brain intact would normally make resleeving much more time-consuming, because it would require the use of medical nanites (like those produced by an ego bridge) to read or write to the organic tissue; to avoid this, the nervous tissues have been augmented with specialized "state channels" connecting to the cyberbrain.
These channels make it possible for the cyberbrain to update synaptic efficiencies directly, which significantly speeds up sleeving and backups.
(It does not, of course, help when bulk "rewiring" is required.)
All told, this means that, despite having significantly more organic cortex present, resleeving takes roughly the same amount of time as a standard pod brain.

### Coop Revered Armor

Revered Armor is ultra-high-end armor granted by the TQZ-GC to recognize the contributions of elite members.
It's similar in concept to a smar-matter vacsuit, but significantly upgraded.
The armor consists of several distinct components, which are worn on different portions of the body; this includes a harness-like primary element worn around the torso, which contains the main hives, power reserves, and life-support maker, and supporting hives worn around the wrists, ankles, and neck.
Much like a smart-matter vacsuit, when activated, the armor extrudes a nanofluid that completely covers the user, forming an environmental barrier and providing substantial physical protection.
Beyond being tougher, the armor also sports a number of upgrades, selected to help coop members survive the border of the TQZ.

- Type: Gear
- Armor: 15E / 15K
- Upgrades: Active Camouflage (as chameleon coating), Immunogenic Systems, Lotus Coating, Reactive Coating, Reduced Signature (-20 to attempts to detect with radar or t-rays), Self-Healing, Shock Proof, Thermal Dampening
- Embedded Systms: Claws, Climbing Harnesses, Grip Pads, Life-Support Maker (provides life support indefinitely, depending on power), Personal Computer, Radio, Radio Booster, Terrahertz Emitter, Viewers, Wrist-Mounted Tools
- Available: TITAN Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative (elite members only)

### Ranger Utilitool

The *ranger utilitool* (or "cop utilitool") is an enhanced utilitool fielded by some law-enforcement agencies on Mars, notably including Mars Rangers.
The ranger utilitool is significantly larger than a standard utilitool, and is designed to be either carried by hand (like a normal utilitool) or fixed to a standard under-barrel mount-point.

Besides the functions of a normal utilitool, the ranger utilitool is capable of functioning as a *cross-spectrum light*, a *t-ray emitter*, a *baton*, a *bayonet*, or a *vibroblade*.
When used as a weapon, it is also capable of delivering shocks \[as a Shock attack\] – although it cannot deliver the voltage that standard police batons and shock-gloves can carry \[\+10 to tests to resist\], because the nanites in the tool have a limited ability to assemble wiring (and obviously cannot carry current themselves).

The tool also has four extendible grip-pads around the face-plate, which can be used to lock the device to a surface (either magnetically or with a "gecko-pad" effect).
In this configuration, the device can also be placed in a "drill" or "breach" mode, which can be used to breach many surfaces and barriers.
This mode has been a source of controversy, as there are reports of the device being used in this way on people in custody.

### Sentinel Mask

The Sentinel Mask is heavily-modified open-source AR headset.
Some highly security-conscious individuals – including some Sentinels, for obvious reasons – use external computers instead of cranial computers.
This requires the use of AR headsets (and sometimes other devices, like motion-tracking rings or bracelets) in order to interact with the devices, and to access AR and simulspaces.
The Sentinel Mask began life as a modified open-source AR headset commonly used by a particular Sentinel; it was eventually contributed to the Eye, where other users have further modified it.
The current version is run as an open-source internal project, as part of CASE:ENFIELD \[repository: SentinelMask | mailing list: \@SentinelMask\ | maintainers: \@anarcat \@\*Akimbo].

The mask is a wrap-around design; it fits snugly, completely covering the user's eyes and wrapping around their head.
It is made of a soft, light-weight material; while it would not be considered a meta-material by modern standards, it does have chromoplast cells that can be used to adjust the color and opacity of the headset (except for the completely opaque eye cups), and it contain muscular fibers that can expand and contract, allowing the wearer to adjust the fit of the headset.
It also contains small air channels that can open and close, complete with micro-motors for circulation; this allows the headset to allow air circulation, which can be vital given how snugly it fits.
The basic blueprint also includes several different headset designs, including variants that use bone-conduction, small in-ear buds, or cups that cover the ears completely.

Beyond the standard functions of an AR headset, the Sentinel Mask has been substantially upgraded.
It includes high-resolution trans-spectral cameras facing forward, smaller cameras placed around the device, and a T-ray emitter; the forward cameras are also polarized.

Particularly relevant to sentinels, the device is designed to defend against sensory threats.
The displays fit snugly over the eyes, blocking out outside light; if the variant with in-ear or over-ear headsets are used, they are also designed to fight tightly, and isolate the ear from outside sound.
The sensors that feed the device are glare-defeating, and are designed to filter out high-intensity inputs.
The device also has a "dampening mode" that can be activated, designed to resist incapacitating inputs; as the name implies, it heavily blurs incoming visual inputs, and muffles sounds.
(Of course, since we are still unsure how basilisk hacks work, we cannot be sure how effective this mode may or may not be; Sentinels should consider it a last-ditch measure.)

And, of course, the headsets are noise-cancelling.

The headband also includes several small compartments, providing space to store small objects.
Two of these compartments – the ones on either side of the head, covering the temples – include small fiber and power ports, allowing small electronic devices (like ectos, farcasters, nanite hives, or additional batteries) to be hard-wired into the headset.
Importantly, these compartments are also woven with muscle fibers, allowing them to secure any object placed in them, and allowing them to seal the access apertures.

One important feature is a hardware power button placed just over the bridge of the nose.
The button is small and slightly recessed, making it difficult to hit by accident; if it is held down for three seconds, the device's batteries will be disconnected, powering the device down immediately.
This is a vital feature for security-conscious sentinels, as it allows them to reliably and quickly disable the device if it is compromised.
(The device is designed so that the muscle fibres will maintain tone and the eye- and ear-cups will fit tightly even if it is powered down, allowing it to provide some defense from intense light and sound – and possibly basilisk hacks – even if it is powered down.)
Conversely, the device also has "secure lock" and "secure shutdown" commands, which prevent the device from being unlocked or powered up unless user-configurable security inputs (which can include passwords, software keys, biometric data, or hardware tokens) are provided.

### Sentinel Utilitool

The Sentinel Utilitool is a variant of an open-source utilitool, modified for use by sentinels; it is designed to mimic some of the advanced features of COTs in a cheaper (and more inconspicuous) device.
The swarm composition of a Sentinel utilitool contains some elements not found in most other utilitools, among them nanites designed to connect to devices, and to resist infection by hostile nanoswarms.
However, in order to accommodate the additional hive elements, it is also slightly larger than most utilitools.
(The additional components are also *masked*, so that it can pass as a normal – if slightly large – utilitool.)

The Sentinel utilitool was contributed and maintained by \@anarcat, and published through CASE: CREATIVE DESTRUCTION.

- Type: Gear
- Available: The Eye (blueprint for \[Medium\])

Besides the functions of a standard utilitool, the sentinel utilitool can connect to devices it is brought in contact with (as *skinlink*), and can resist infection by hostile nanotech it comes into contact with (as the *immunogenic system* mod).
It also has programming to mimic (most of) the functions of a COT – although it is less effective at doing so (-20 penalty to tests), as it is missing some of the more specialized components and swarm elements that COTs use.
Finally, the Sentinel utilitool is designed to pass as a standard utilitool (treat as though the additional features are *masked* upgrades).

### Wildcat

The Wildcat is a common, mass-produced combat bot that appears throughout the inner system.
While it mainly produced and deployed within the Planetary Consortium, it can also be found in the police forces of the Morningstar Constellation, in the Lunar-LaGrange Alliance, and even in parts of the Extropian main belt.
Physically, they are small, quadrupedal bots, with a lean layout built to run, and a turret mounted top-center.
There is no "head" to obstruct the turret's field of view; sensors are positioned around the bot, and the cyberbrain is well-protected in the center of the mech.
(Because this would limit the bot's ability to peek around or over obstacles, it is equipped with a single, articulated fiberoptic camera, mounted center-front.)

Though its specifications might not be impressive, the bot should not be underestimated.
It is a practical and efficient piece of military hardware, well adapted to its particular role.
In particular, it is cheap enough to be deployed in tens and hundreds, even by relatively small police forces, and it is designed to be particularly effective in groups; Sentinels should never assume that they are only facing one Wildcat.

Sentinels should also note the specialized gear that the Wildcat is equipped with, which allow it to foil many common tactics.
The bots boast an redundant and boosted antenna array, which gives them a powerful edge in jamming; built-in farcasters make them effectively impossible to hack without careful planning; the bot ALIs include an infosec defense package, which allows them to put up surprising resistance even if they are compromised; and sonar and x-ray systems allow them to defeat most forms of optical chamoflage (including invisible metamaterials).
