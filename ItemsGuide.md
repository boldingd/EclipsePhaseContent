### Clever Bandit

The Clever Bandit is the result of a Firewall project to create an infiltration-focused biomorph.
This makes it both unusual (since infiltration, like combat, is often best-handled by synthmorphs, or through indirect means) and rare (since Firewall lacks the resources to produce a morph line at large scale – obviously).
The genetics and templates for the Clever Bandit are made available on the Eye – subject to demonstrable need-to-know, of course – and a few are kept ready near major population centers.

Within the Eye, the Clever Bandit is developed as a collaborative, open-source project.
The project's current maintainer is @Runblader, and discussion happens in a CASE: PRIMORDIAL CRAFT subgroup.
As a small, open-source project, a number of forks and variants have been created, and the project sometimes reflects the quirks and preferences of the maintainers more than any systematic analysis of agents' needs.

**\/\/ Need-to-Know Only: Asyncs**

Some specialist work has gone into the morph's brain, to maximize it's utility for asyncs.
Unlike most other pods, more than half of the original raccoon brain has been kept intact – notably including the large portions of the somatosensory cortex that process the raccoons unique sense of touch.
Among other things, this extra nervous tissue makes the use of "sleights" significantly easier and more effective than most other pods.

Keeping so much brain intact would normally make resleeving much more time-consuming, because it would require the medical nanites produced by ego bridge to read or write much more organic tissue; to avoid this, the nervous tissues have been augmented with specialized "state channels" connecting to the cyberbrain.
These channels make it possible for the cyber-brain to read synapse more than half of the synapse-states without the use of cortical nanites; in turn, this sigificantly speeds up sleeving and backups.
All told, this means that, despite having significantly more organic cortex present, resleeving takes the same amount of time as a standard pod brain.

### Coop Revered Armor

Revered Armor is ultra-high-end armor granted by the TQZ-GC to recognize the contributions of elite members.
It's similar to a smart-matter vac-suit, but significantly upgraded.

### Ranger Utilitool

The *ranger utilitool* (or "cop utilitool") is an enhanced utilitool fielded by some law-enforcement agencies on Mars, notably Mars Rangers.
The ranger utilitool is larger than a standard utilitool, and is designed to be either carried by hand (like a normal utilitool) or fixed to standard under-barrel mount-points.

Besides the functions of a normal utilitool, the ranger utilitool is capable fo functioning as a *cross-spectrum light*, a *t-ray emitter*, a *baton*, a *bayonet*, or a *vibroblade*.
When used as a weapon, it is also capable of delivering shocks \[as a Shock attack\] – although it cannot deliver the voltage that standard police batons and shock-gloves can carry \[\+10 to tests to resist\], because the nanites in the tool have a limited ability to assemble wiring.

The tool also has four extendible grip-pads around the face-plate, which can be used to lock the device to a surface (either magnetically or by a "gecko-pad" effect).
In this configuration, the device can also be placed in a "drill" or "breach" mode, which can be used to breach many surfaces and barriers.
This mode has been a source of controversy, however, as there are reports of the device being used in this way on people in custody.

> **0514NOMAD**: I know it doesn't help anything, but I did once see a Ranger use the breach-mode to get the stack out of a 9 Lives, a Gede.
> So sometimes it does happen to people who have it coming.

### Sentinel Utilitool

The Sentinel Utilitool is a modified variant of an open-source utilitool, designed to mimic some of the advanced features of COTs in a cheaper (and more inconspicuous) device.
The swarm composition of a Sentinel utilitool contains some elements not found in most other utilitools, among them nanites designed to connect to devices, and to resist infection by hostile nanoswarms.
However, in order to accommodate the additional hive elements, it is also slightly larger than most utilitools.
(The additional components are also *masked*, so that it can pass as a normal – if slightly large – utilitool.)

The Sentinel utilitool was contributed and maintained by \@anarcat, and published through CASE: CREATIVE DESTRUCTION.

- Type: Gear
- Available: The Eye (blueprint for \[Medium\])

Besides the functions of a standard utilitool, the sentinel utilitool can connect to devices it is brought in contact with (as *skinlink*), and can resist infection by hostile nanotech (as the *immunogenic system* mod).
It also has programming to mimic (most of) the functions of a COT – although it is less effective at doing so (-20 penalty to tests), as it is missing some of the more specialized components and swarm elements that COTs use.
Finally, the Sentinel utilitool is designed to pass as a standard utilitool (treat as though the additional features are *masked* upgrades).
