### Burro

The Burro is a ubiquitous drone truck of Extropian production, found throughout thousands of work site throughout the inner and outer system.
Despite being a relatively new design, having only launched in AF 4, it has already earned a solid reputation as a reliable, inexpensive, no-frills construction vehicle.

Physically, the Burro consists of a large truck bed, mounted on a three-axle electric vehicle frame.
The drone is "omni-directional"; it does not have any kind of cabin, and can steer with both the front and rear wheels.
Like most autonomous vehicles, the drone includes a variety of sensors, including cameras, lidar, and radar; some of these are mounted on masts on the periphery of the drone, while other systems are positioned around the body of the vehicle.
Notably, some of these sensors face into the bed, allowing the vehicle to actively monitor its cargo while driving.

The Burro is a no-frills, basic, inexpensive design, making limited use of advanced metamaterials or other expensive components.
Despite that, it is well-regarded for its ruggedness, practicality, and the design of its ALI.
Burros are known for the sophisticated understanding of job sites, displaying a remarkable ability to "do the right thing" with little or no explicit direction.
They are also known for their extreme stubbornness about worksite safety – the ALI will refuse to carry out any instructions that it deems to be unsafe (which some love and others revile).

> **Bauble**: Working-class Lunars love these things.
> There are unions and Liberator cells with Burros on their graphics.
> Some of the big unions won't take contracts with someone who's swapped the ALIs on their Burros.
> It's a sure sign they've decided poor folks' and their morphs are disposable.

The Burro is produced by the Burro Consortium, a (primarily) Extropian conglomerate.
The Consortium exists solely to produce and distribute the vehicle; it was formed in AF 2 when the Atlas Drone Cooperative, a Mutualist cooperative located on New Pittsburgh in the Main Belt, assembled a web of minor partners for the purpose of producing a new industrial vehicle.
The Atlas Drone Cooperative is still the dominant presence in the Burro Consortium; they are the largest member, the majority stakeholders in the Consortium, and are primarily responsible for designing and distributing the vehicle.
However, they include a number of minor members: among them are *Mind of the Burro*, an an-cap microcorp primarily responsible for the fine-tuning of the Burro's famed ALI; New Pittsburgh Design Intelligence, a firm that does feedback, surveying, and requirements-gathering; and Williams, Renault, and Cho, a Mutualist partnership that specializes in export law.

> So this is the one Extropian coop that values people more than profit?

> **anarcat**: Come on, Gunslinger.
> You can do better than that, that's just lazy.

Wide, cheap availability means that Burros are frequently modified.
A number of after-market kits exist, and many shops have experience doing custom work.
Notably, many mod kits and after-market replacements also exist for the ALI; many of these kits "relax" the ALI's strict concerns for work-site safety.
It is a testament to the Burro's wide reach, and the quality of its default ALI, that strikes have been called to prevent the default ALI from being replaced with a more "efficient" one.

A number of operators have also modified the vehicle to serve as a technical.
The high, open bed allows a weapon mount to be easily installed; a number of weapons have been deployed by guerilla and irregular forces, in conflicts ranging between Extropian squabbles to full-on brush-wars in the Martian outback.
(Of course, the default ALI is unable to use these weapons; they require either a second operator, a skillsoft for the ALI, or an ALI replacement.)

> **Gunslinger@MONOLITH**: Technical refits are usually pretty minimal, because "cheap and quick" is usually the whole point.
> They don't do much more than cut a hole in the bed and mount a turret.
> Sometimes all they do is bolt a tripod down!

> There are a few in the outback, though, who have put more effort in.

### Clever Bandit

The Clever Bandit is the result of a Firewall project to create an infiltration-focused biomorph.
This makes it both unusual (since infiltration, like combat, is often best handled by synthmorphs, or through indirect means) and rare (since Firewall obviously lacks the resources to produce a morph line at large scale).
The genetics and templates for the Clever Bandit are made available on the Eye – subject to demonstrable need-to-know, of course – and a few are kept ready near major population centers.

Within the Eye, the Clever Bandit is developed as a collaborative, open-source project.
The project's current maintainer is @tyrell, and discussion happens in a CASE: PRIMORDIAL CRAFT subgroup.
As a small, open-source project, several branches and forks have been created, and the project sometimes reflects the quirks and preferences of the maintainers more than any systematic analysis of Sentinels' needs.

**\/\/ Need-to-Know Only: Asyncs**

The morph was created to cater to async infiltrators, so extensive work has gone into the biological portions of the morph's brain.
Unlike most other pods, more than half of the original raccoon brain has been kept intact – notably including the portions of the somatosensory cortex that process the raccoons unique sense of touch.
Beyond preserving the raccoon's exceptional sense of touch, this extra nervous tissue makes the use of "sleights" significantly easier and more effective than would normally be the case.

Keeping so much of the brain intact would normally make resleeving much more time-consuming, because it would require the use of medical nanites (like those produced by an ego bridge) to read or write to the organic tissue; to avoid this, the nervous tissues have been augmented with specialized "state channels" connecting to the cyberbrain.
These channels make it possible for the cyberbrain to update synaptic efficiencies directly, which significantly speeds up sleeving and backups.
(It does not, of course, help when bulk "rewiring" is required.)
All told, this means that, despite having significantly more organic cortex present, resleeving takes roughly the same amount of time as a standard pod brain.

### Coop Revered Armor

Revered Armor is ultra-high-end armor granted by the TQZ-GC to recognize the contributions of elite members.
It's similar in concept to a smar-matter vacsuit, but significantly upgraded.
The armor consists of several distinct components, which are worn on different portions of the body; this includes a harness-like primary element worn around the torso, which contains the main hives, power reserves, and life-support maker, and supporting hives worn around the wrists, ankles, and neck.
Much like a smart-matter vacsuit, when activated, the armor extrudes a nanofluid that completely covers the user, forming an environmental barrier and providing substantial physical protection.
Beyond being tougher, the armor also sports a number of upgrades, selected to help coop members survive the border of the TQZ.

- Type: Gear
- Armor: 15E / 15K
- Upgrades: Active Camouflage (as chameleon coating), Immunogenic Systems, Lotus Coating, Reactive Coating, Reduced Signature (-20 to attempts to detect with radar or t-rays), Self-Healing, Shock Proof, Thermal Dampening

- Available: TITAN Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative (elite members only)

### Ranger Utilitool

The *ranger utilitool* (or "cop utilitool") is an enhanced utilitool fielded by some law-enforcement agencies on Mars, notably including Mars Rangers.
The ranger utilitool is significantly larger than a standard utilitool, and is designed to be either carried by hand (like a normal utilitool) or fixed to a standard under-barrel mount-point.

Besides the functions of a normal utilitool, the ranger utilitool is capable of functioning as a *cross-spectrum light*, a *t-ray emitter*, a *baton*, a *bayonet*, or a *vibroblade*.
When used as a weapon, it is also capable of delivering shocks \[as a Shock attack\] – although it cannot deliver the voltage that standard police batons and shock-gloves can carry \[\+10 to tests to resist\], because the nanites in the tool have a limited ability to assemble wiring (and obviously cannot carry current themselves).

The tool also has four extendible grip-pads around the face-plate, which can be used to lock the device to a surface (either magnetically or with a "gecko-pad" effect).
In this configuration, the device can also be placed in a "drill" or "breach" mode, which can be used to breach many surfaces and barriers.
This mode has been a source of controversy, as there are reports of the device being used in this way on people in custody.

### Roadrunner

Roadrunners are cheap 'bots produced in the Planetary Consortium and sold to law-enforcement agencies in the Tharsis League and Consortium.
Roadrunners are designed to aid in situational awareness – they are scouts, observers, and pursuit-bots, not combat elements.
They are intended to be cheap enough to issue several to officers, and for losses of the 'bots to be acceptable.
While a handful of small weapons modules exist, they are rarely issued; most Roadrunners are deployed unarmed.

Roadrunners are designed to be agile on the ground and in the air.
(That, as well as their size, gives them their name; they do not have much *direct* resemblance to the old-Earth bird.)
Their narrow bodies support partially-articulated delta wings, powerful hind legs designed for running and jumping, and thinner forelimbs designed for fine manipulation.
They are quick for a bot their size, able to pace most transhumans at a run, and easily handle Mars' broken terrain.
They also include a small internal turbofan engine and a limited supply of methane to power it; this gives them a quick airspeed, and a total flight time of almost thirty minutes.
Vectored nozzles for and aft, combined with the articulation of the wings, can make the drone surprisingly agile in flight; it can maneuver in tight quarters, can take off from a running leap (or after being thrown), hover for short periods, and land vertically.
(It is primarily designed for Mars' gravity; under "standard" gravity, it can still fly, but requires more space to take off and land.  It also cannot carry weapons in standard gravity.)

While Roadrunners can run fairly quickly, they are better leapers and flyers; in use, Roadrunners tend to use their facilities with leaping and flying together with their magnetic systems to stay high, above their targets.
While Roadrunners can use their turbofans in short bursts for quick, powerful leaps, their supply of fuel is limited; once they have the high ground, they often run, leap, and glide to preserve fuel.
Their powered flight capability is mainly used for open pursuits.

Roadrunners are also equipped with spotlights, holoprojectors, and loudspeakers, so that they can address suspects.

### Seeker Carrier

The Seeker Carrier is a cheap, disposable weapons platform designed by an autonomist cooperative and distributed to autonomist-aligned fighters in the Inner System, most notably the Movement.
It's a very straightforward design: it is a small, four-wheeled robot, equipped with a single turret, and loaded with seekers.
The bot has just enough 'ware to make its expected performance worth the fab resources; being an open, autonomist design, individual users are free to modify the blueprint according to their needs and resources.

In addition to the 'bot itself, the Autonomists have produced the blueprints for a nanohive; the hive produces Proteans, and the Proteans produce a 'bot and weapons.
This package is far more dangerous; it allows anyone with a 'faber capable of producing the hive to eventually produce large numbers of seeker-carriers.

We have secured a copy of the drone blueprints for the Eye; current policy, however, minimizes their use, in order to avoid reprisals against third-parties (i.e. to avoid kicking off a major conflict in the Outback).
We haven not managed to secure a copy of the protean hive.

### Sentinel Mask

The Sentinel Mask is heavily-modified open-source AR headset.
Some highly security-conscious individuals – including some Sentinels, for obvious reasons – use external computers instead of cranial computers.
This requires the use of AR headsets (and sometimes other devices, like motion-tracking rings or bracelets) in order to interact with the devices, and to access AR and simulspaces.
The Sentinel Mask began life as a modified open-source AR headset commonly used by a particular Sentinel; it was eventually contributed to the Eye, where other users have further modified it.
The current version is run as an open-source internal project, as part of CASE:ENFIELD \[repository: SentinelMask | mailing list: \@SentinelMask\ | maintainers: \@anarcat \@\*Akimbo].

The mask is a wrap-around design; it fits snugly, completely covering the user's eyes and wrapping around their head.
It is made of a soft, light-weight material; while it would not be considered a meta-material by modern standards, it does have chromoplast cells that can be used to adjust the color and opacity of the headset (except for the completely opaque eye cups), and it contain muscular fibers that can expand and contract, allowing the wearer to adjust the fit of the headset.
It also contains small air channels that can open and close, complete with micro-motors for circulation; this allows the headset to allow air circulation, which can be vital given how snugly it fits.
The basic blueprint also includes several different headset designs, including variants that use bone-conduction, small in-ear buds, or cups that cover the ears completely.

Beyond the standard functions of an AR headset, the Sentinel Mask has been substantially upgraded.
It includes high-resolution trans-spectral cameras facing forward, smaller cameras placed around the device, and a T-ray emitter; the forward cameras are also polarized.

Particularly relevant to sentinels, the device is designed to defend against sensory threats.
The displays fit snugly over the eyes, blocking out outside light; if the variant with in-ear or over-ear headsets are used, they are also designed to fight tightly, and isolate the ear from outside sound.
The sensors that feed the device are glare-defeating, and are designed to filter out high-intensity inputs.
The device also has a "dampening mode" that can be activated, designed to resist incapacitating inputs; as the name implies, it heavily blurs incoming visual inputs, and muffles sounds.
(Of course, since we are still unsure how basilisk hacks work, we cannot be sure how effective this mode may or may not be; Sentinels should consider it a last-ditch measure.)

And, of course, the headsets are noise-cancelling.

The headband also includes several small compartments, providing space to store small objects.
Two of these compartments – the ones on either side of the head, covering the temples – include small fiber and power ports, allowing small electronic devices (like ectos, farcasters, nanite hives, or additional batteries) to be hard-wired into the headset.
Importantly, these compartments are also woven with muscle fibers, allowing them to secure any object placed in them, and allowing them to seal the access apertures.

One important feature is a hardware power button placed just over the bridge of the nose.
The button is small and slightly recessed, making it difficult to hit by accident; if it is held down for three seconds, the device's batteries will be disconnected, powering the device down immediately.
This is a vital feature for security-conscious sentinels, as it allows them to reliably and quickly disable the device if it is compromised.
(The device is designed so that the muscle fibres will maintain tone and the eye- and ear-cups will fit tightly even if it is powered down, allowing it to provide some defense from intense light and sound – and possibly basilisk hacks – even if it is powered down.)
Conversely, the device also has "secure lock" and "secure shutdown" commands, which prevent the device from being unlocked or powered up unless user-configurable security inputs (which can include passwords, software keys, biometric data, or hardware tokens) are provided.

### Sentinel Utilitool

The Sentinel Utilitool is a variant of an open-source utilitool, modified for use by sentinels; it is designed to mimic some of the advanced features of COTs in a cheaper (and more inconspicuous) device.
The swarm composition of a Sentinel utilitool contains some elements not found in other utilitools, among them nanites designed to connect to devices, and to resist infection by hostile nanoswarms.
However, in order to accommodate the additional hive elements, it is also slightly larger than most utilitools.
(The additional components are also *masked*, so that it can pass as a normal – if slightly large – utilitool.)

The Sentinel utilitool was contributed and maintained by \@anarcat, and published through CASE: CREATIVE DESTRUCTION.

- Type: Gear
- Available: The Eye (blueprint for \[Medium\])

Besides the functions of a standard utilitool, the sentinel utilitool can connect to devices it is brought in contact with (as *skinlink*), and can resist infection by hostile nanotech it comes into contact with (as the *immunogenic system* mod).
It also has programming to mimic (most of) the functions of a COT – although it is less effective at doing so (-20 penalty to tests), as it is missing some of the more specialized components and swarm elements that COTs use.
Finally, the Sentinel utilitool is designed to pass as a standard utilitool (treat as though the additional features are *masked* upgrades).

### Termite Hive

Termite hives are 

### Tile

Tiles are small bots roughly similar to other scout bots.
Shaped vaguely like a crab, they are small enough to fit in your hand, have a roughly square layout, and a streamlined cross-section; they are propelled by six legs, and have two small arms in the front.
They also have two narrow air intakes, given them the appearance of gills.
(They do not, for the record, have claws.)

Tiles are primarily designed for exploring abandoned outposts and ruins in the Martian outback.
They were originally developed for the purpose under contract to the Mars Rangers; they are, however, available on the open market, and are also purchased and deployed by a variety of users (from maker nomads to gatecrashers) and deployed in a variety of other locations (from asteroid habs in the belt to the sub-crustal seas of Europa).

Tiles are designed to be cheap and simple enough to produce with fabbers in the field, while also being equipped to detect (if not defeat) the unique hazards posed by possible TITAN opponents.
This allows Rangers the ability to deploy many of the bots into their areas of operation, giving them good tactical coverage, and a heads-up if Exsurgents threats are present.

The nanophages present on some versions are easily their most expensive and sophisticated component; to keep costs down, versions are available with and without them.
Notably, the Mars Rangers have their own nanophage package, which is only available on bots that they purchase; the Rangers claim that their package will also attack biological threat, but this has not been verified, and the package's exact capabilities are unknown.

> **\*Akimbo**: The anti-nanotech requirement is infamous in military hardware circles.
> The Rangers really want some kind of nanite defense, but they also want the bot to be cost-competitive with other scouts.
>
> Olympus Military Technology has been flailing around, trying to find some kind of anti-nanotech package that will keep the Rangers happy while somehow costing a quarter of what an open-market nanophage package costs.
> Meanwhile, the Rangers have been patching in their own custom nanophage package.
> A lot of old fabbers can't produce it, but they're the goddamn Tharsis League, so they can afford to update their fabbers to current spec.

### Wildcat

The Wildcat is a common, mass-produced combat bot that appears throughout the inner system.
While it is mainly produced and deployed within the Planetary Consortium, it can also be found in the police forces of the Morningstar Constellation, in the Lunar-LaGrange Alliance, and even in parts of the Extropian main belt.
Physically, they are small, quadrupedal bots, with a lean layout built to run, and a turret mounted top-center.
There is no "head" to obstruct the turret's field of view; sensors are positioned around the bot, and the cyberbrain is well-protected in the center of the mech.
(Because this would limit the bot's ability to peek around or over obstacles, it is equipped with a single, articulated fiberoptic camera, mounted on the front of the mech.)

Though its specifications might not be impressive, the bot should not be underestimated.
It is a practical and efficient piece of military hardware, well adapted to its particular role.
In particular, it is cheap enough to be deployed in tens and hundreds, even by relatively small police forces, military hypercorps, and mercenary outfits, and it is designed to be particularly effective in groups; Sentinels should never assume that they are only facing one Wildcat.

Sentinels should also note the specialized gear that the Wildcat is equipped with, which allow it to counter many expected threats in its various roles.
The bots boast a redundant and boosted antenna array, which gives them an edge in jamming and EW fights; built-in farcasters make them effectively impossible to hack without careful planning; the bot ALIs include an infosec defense package, which allows them to put up meaningful resistance even if they are compromised; and sonar and x-ray systems allow them to defeat most forms of optical camouflage (including invisible metamaterials).
