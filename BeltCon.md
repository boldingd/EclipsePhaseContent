# Belt-Con

Belt-Con is an Extropian Mutualist mining cooperative that operates in the 'belt.
The community is centered around one large ship, the *Belt-Con*, which is as much (or more) habitat than mining ship; it features not only extensive ore-processing and industrial facilities but two large centri-grav segments and a large block of residential servers.
The community also controls one smaller centrigrav module hab, located near an asteroid that they mined out, as well as some facilities and stores within the asteroid.

## History

The *Large-Scale Mutualist Mining Cooperative* was founded in BF 35.
Besides profitable mining in the asteroid belt and a fair sharing of profits among the members, the cooperative also offered a high degree of automation (for the time), a low degree of required labor, and freedom to pursue Extropian body-modification projects away from Earth.

Initially, the cooperative was to have been run by direct-democratic vote of all the members; however, that rapidly proved impractical, as at least one proposal that was physically impossible passed a majority vote.
To remedy the situation, the Cooperative formed a number of managing committees, responsible for setting long-range policy; these committees were largely allowed to make their own rules and establish their own requirements for membership, and their proposals had to be given an up-or-down vote before the community as a whole could modify them.
The ship was launched in BF 32.

In part due to its low labor requirements and sizable bank of servers, the Community attracted a sizable contingent of people interested in vanishing into simulspaces – transhumanists, "cyber-athletes" and sci-fi and fantasy enthusiasts.
This contingent has given the Cooperative a sort of "convention atmosphere," giving it the nickname that it's more commonly known by: "Belt-Con."
(This population has also shaped the Cooperative's economy and politics, as many of them have low rates of participation in either labor or governance.)

Nevertheless, the Cooperative has long been profitable, and those in the community with longer views have long sought to see the community branch out into other areas, to become more of a self-sufficient and stable community.
To that end, the Cooperative has embarked on a number of building projects.

In BF 9, the community occupied a metallic 19km-radius asteroid that they had mined out, christening it the "Depot."
They intended it primarily for secured storage, rather than for occupation; they filled it with storage-facilities and back-up vaults.
For actual living and working space, they built a module-hab in orbit of the asteroid, called "Hightown"; it was completed in BF 7.
The Cooperative set out on a long-term project to lure professionals in other fields to Hightown.

In BF 1, they had attracted a viable tool of spacecraft-design talen, and began the construction of a small shipyard.
Construction was paused during the Fall; the community consttucted a number of cold-storage archives, and received a flood of egocasts.
Construction was resumed less than a year after the fall, and the shipyard was completed in BF 2.

The shipyard, together with its crews and microcorps, spent the next few years on small-scale construction runs and refit contracts.
Only last year, in AF 9, they completed a significant project: they constructed the community's second mining operation.
Formally and simply called Fleet 2, the fleet is more commonly referred to as the Swarm.

This year, in AF 10, the Cooperative has courted controversy by pursuing contracts to produce warships for several autonomist-aligned cooperatives.
The intent is to give the Autonomist Alliance viable "patrol and response capabilities," independent of the Titanian Commonwealth.
This has led to some stark conflict in Autonomist circles; some have vigorously pursued contracts, while others feel that ratcheting up tension in the solar-system is a fool's errand, and that building warships and projecting power through military might is inherently contrary to autonomist principles.

Given the "eccentric" nature of the Community, they've retained relatively few of their infugees.
Even now, more than half of the influx – almost forty-nine thousand souls – remain in cold storage.
Of those who have been revived, about two-thirds have left the community to seek opportunities elsewhere; only about sixteen thousand have chosen to stay.
Of those that have, many live in a cluster of server-satellite in orbit around the Depot; these are commonly referred to as Oldtown, since they tend to run simulspaces that resemble old-world Earth.

## Operating in the Belt

### The Economy

Formally, the Cooperative is still a worker-owned Extropian Mutualist mining cooperative, centered around a large mining ship; in practice, the Cooperative is active in a number of other fields, controls a number of other facilities, and has developed stable institutions and public services more akin to a government.
At this point, it is as much a *community* as a cooperative – if not more.

Formally, the Cooperative is worker-owned along Mutualist lines.
Every member is an equal member, entitled to an equal share of the community's profits, and responsible for a fair share of the labor.
Major decisions are made by a direct, equal poll of all members.

However, the profits shared out among the members depend on how much of the community's productive output is sold for profit, as opposed to being either held in reserve or used for development.
In practice, while the Cooperative does sell off a substantial quantity of material and turn a healthy profit, it also holds a significant amount of material in reserve, and has initiated several other construction projects and business ventures.
This means that the profit shared out to the members is relatively small; sufficient for a comfortable existence, but hardly extravagant.

Being a Mutualist community, members are free to engage in other productive economic activities; they are required to pay *rent* on any capital they lease from the community, and must abide by certain restrictions enforced by the Cooperative, but are otherwise free to arrange their own affairs as they see fit, along Extropian lines.
Many members of the community engage in other productive work, contributing to an increasingly vibrant internal economy; others subsist on the minimal payout, preferring to avoid labor and maximize their leisure time.

From the beginning, the Cooperative has sought to maximize automation and minimize labor requirements; at present, minimum labor obligations work out to around 8 hours per week.
Workers can volunteer for preferred tasks; assuming that they are qualified and perform adequately, volunteers receive a small bonus.
After that, remaining tasks are assigned by lottery.
Importantly, substitutions are allowed, which produces a sizable secondary market in labor.

Taken together, these factors can lead to a certain amount of "class" conflict.
Some members of the Cooperative either volunteer for tasks, participate in either the internal or external economy, or both; others, the unskilled or unmotivated, only meet the minimum labor requirement when selected by the lottery.
Not only does the first group have access to resources that the second does not, but, because labor requirements can effectively be bought off, they have different obligations to the community.

### Governance

In principle, the Cooperative is run by a direct and equal poll of all of its members; in practice, direct democracy proved unworkable.
The community set up *committees*, who could select their own members and set their own rules – within certain limits.
There are two types of committees: *planning committees,* whose role is to establish long-term plans and establish rules, and *operating groups*, who are responsible for carrying out certain projects or managing certain areas of operation.
(As a rule, planning committees and operating groups must be separate.)
When released, the policy proposals of the planning committees must receive an up-or-down vote; if they fail, they are returned for review.
Upon review, they receive a second up-or-down vote; only if they fail a second time can the community modify or completely reject them.

The Cooperative has very low vote-participation rates; this means that, in practice, the committees' set the agenda for the ship.
