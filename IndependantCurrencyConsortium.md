# The Independant Currency Consortium

The Independant Currency Consortium is a banking consortium that operates a "long-range currency," a currency that's valid across multiple regions in the solar system.
Essentially, they are a smaller, Extropian-organized competitor to the Progress Bank; their major benefit is that they are independant of the Planetary Consortium (and any other government), and offer far more robust privacy protections.

## Basics

A major motivation for crypto-currency is to be resistant to any effort by a state to regulate, interfere with, or out-right prohibit the currency; their design sacrifices efficiency and practicality to achieve this goal.
Notably, because of the need to synchronize a large amount of data between a large number of individuals, crypto-currencies do not cross the communications bottlenecks created by long-range inter-"neighborhood" communication.
Effectively, each "orbital neighborhood" maintains their own, local cryptocurrencies.

In the modern era, there are no large states to seek to enforce a monopoly on the money supply, so there is no barrior to a private bank simply printing their own currency, and no need for the design trade-offs of crypto-currencies.

The Independant Currency Consortium is a private banking consortium established by financial firms hailing from several Extropian habitats.
It was established in BF 11 — meaning that it predates the Progress Bank and the Consortium credit, amusingly enough.
It consists of several Regional Central Banks, institutions responsible for managing the supply ICC Marks, and member and leaf banks, responsible for accepting deposits in ICC Marks.

Like a national currency (like the Venusian Lyra) or a crypto-currency, the ICC Mark is purely a medium of exchange.
It is not backed by any particular deposits or pegged to any other currency; it is only given value by its holders' confidence that they can find items priced (stably) in ICC Marks.

Also like a national currency, but unlike most crypto-currencies, it is managed by a central authority; the ICC manages the supply of ICC Marks, ensuring (relatively) stable pricing and modest inflation.

### Light-Speed Lag

In order to prevent abuses of the system, each ICC Mark is valid only within "range" of the central bank that authorized it — that is, only when close enough to that central bank that a signal can be sent to confirm a transaction and an authorization returned within a reasonable amount of time.
(This means, in practice, within any given orbital neighborhood; for example, in Mars or Martian orbit.)
This does introduce the complexity that, in order to use them in an area other than the one where they where "minted," ICC Marks must be *transferred* from one regional bank to another.
However, unlike the process of selling one crypto-currency to buy another, the Mark retains its value; each Mark is still one ICC Mark, no matter which region it's in.
(Of course, in practice, the differing strengths of the local economies mean that the purchasing power of one ICC Mark can be very different from one habitat to another.)

### Robust Privacy

One major selling-point of the ICC is a robust privacy guarantee: the ICC does not disclose client data, except as necessary to prosecute abuses of the currency itself, crimes against the bank, or when compelled by local law.

The last point is not as broad as it may seem, as ICC Banks (especially ICC Central Banks) are usually situated outside of the territories claimed by other factions.
For example, while there are ICC Branch Banks in closer orbit of the planet, ICC Central Bank Mars is on an independant habitat orbiting 46,000km above the surface, well above geosynchronous orbit and the orbits of Phobos and Progress; ICC Central Bank Jupiter is similarly situated, located in a small Neustro Shell and accompanying satellite swarm, spread out at the Jupiter-Callisto L5 point.

Notably, ICC banks even limit their sharing with each-other, to ensure that a client's personal information is never put within reach of a hostile polity.
Banks share only "essetial" information, including balances, ratings, flags, and the biometric and cryptographic data necessary to identify a client; notably, they do not share a client's detailed transaction history, nor any "secondary" data they may acquire.
(ICC Banks can share detailed information when pursuing an enforcement action; clients who rely on the ICC's limited information sharing are encouraged to remain in their good graces.)

## Trade-Offs

### With Crypto-Currencies

The ICC Mark offers several major benefits over crypto-currencies:

- because it's managed by a central authority, its value is far more stable over time;
- ICC Marks can be transported between regions and spent in different regions without having to be exchanged for a different currency;
- because a public block-chain does not need to be updated, transactions can be processed far more simply and quickly; and
- the ICC Mark operates without computationally-expensive *mining*, or any other proof-of-work or proof-of-stake overhead.

Of course, it also has disadvantages compared to crypto-currencies (depending strongly on their design):

- the ICC itself represents a single authority and point-of-trust, unlike a distributed block-chain;
- (most) crypto-currencies offer stronger pseudonymity or anonymity guarantees;
- (most) crypto-currencies don't have central controlling authorities; and, relatedly,
- (most) crypto-currencies do not have stable values over the long-term, and
- (most) crypto-currencies are roughly deflationary.

(The third, fourth, and fifth points are generally only considered to be *advantages* by people with a particular ideological motivation for doing so; they are included for completeness.)

### With State and Bank Currencies

ICC Marks offer two major benefits over other competing currencies, especially the Consortium Credit:

- the ICC offers a robust privacy guarantee, and
- they are independant of any polity or major party.

Of course, it has one major down-side, compared to Hypercorp Credits: Progress Credits are in *much* wider circulation, and many goods are priced primarily or only in Consortium Credits (or something pegged to them).

## Users

ICC Marks are favored by a range of users, ranging from the legitimate to the illicit: they are popular with those distrust (or cannot work with) the Planetary Consortium; with those people who do business in different locations and with different factions; and, of course, those who want to keep their financial transactions secret, without dealing with the vagaries of crypto-currency.
