# Furry Pandering

> While talking with a friend, I observed that the Critter morph was probably an attempt at pandering to furries, but it was written by someone who didn't "get" us.
> This short document is an attempt at slightly better furry pandering.
> It is half serious, half in jest; hopefully normies can find some humor in it – but if the furry at your gaming table wants to actually run some content from it, that's fine too.

## A Little History

The Furry community goes back more than a century before the Fall.
It had its earliest start before the earliest computer networks, in animation- and "funny animal"-themed physical meet-ups and circulars.

The early internet – the centralized, hardwired equivalent to the modern mesh – turned those small circles into a national and then global phenomenon.
The community started out in the relatively affluent and connected "west," but it spread to the rest of the world as the early internet and digital culture spread.

The Furry community skews educated and left; unsurprisingly, during the early era of space colonization, as Terran governments started to become more restrictive and backward-looking, Furries where slightly more likely than the general population to leave Earth, slightly more likely to be willing to egocast, and more likely to settle in the 'Belt and Outer System.
Worth nothing, though, these are not strong trends: there are Furries in almost every faction and large habitat.

## Furries

Today, furries are still a "mesh-first" sub-culture, distributed sparsely throughout the solar-system.

Coming up with exact numbers is a little tricky – not the least vexing problem is, who counts as a furry? – but I've seen the number 8 million thrown around as an estimate for the total Furry population at the time of the Fall.
At that time, total system population would have been around 10 billion; that gives us a density of roughly one out of every 1250 people, give or take.
Because our population was skewed towards the 'Belt and outer system, we came through the Fall better than some; it looks like there are about 1.1 million of us around today, out of a solar-system population of around 1 billion.
(Infugees in storage were not counted in either number.)

Notably, most furries don't sleeve furry morphs or live in furry communities.
First off, we're scattered through the solar-systems, often in small numbers – sometimes only one or two people on smaller habs.
Second, for many of us, the furry subculture is only one of our many identities and interests; we don't sleeve furry morphs full-time for the same reason that fans of fantasy novels don't sleeve morphs based on elves or orcs.

This is also one of the reasons that counting furries is tricky: how active in the community do you need to be to count?

> **anarcat**: Due disclosure: both of the main writers here, myself and \@\*Ishtar, are sleeved in furry morphs.
> And Ishtar does live on a lifestyler habitat.
>
> …we are not necessarily representative.

For many of us, the mesh and simulspaces give us ample opportunity to express our furrier sides while still keeping our feet firmly planted in the mundane world.

Both furrsuits and mesh overlays remain popular alternatives for meetups and similar situations.
A wide range of options exist for both; there are plenty of highly-customizable open-source products available, but there are also any number of artisans and artists who can create bespoke products.

This isn't to say that lifestyler habs and communities don't exist, of course; but you should understand that they aren't the norm.
The vast majority of furries are normal people, with suits in their closets.

### Meetups and Conferences

For the same reasons – because we are scattered throughout the solar system, only rarely concentrated beyond a small community or group of friends – meetups and conferences are still common.
Most large habs and cities have at least one furry meet-up group, who organize regular events and gatherings; conventions are larger and rarer, gathering attendees from throughout the solar system – and even beyond, as at least on 'crasher has come back to Sol to attend.



## 'Ware

### Biomask

Biomasks are still in development, and are not production-ready or generally available; they are included for completeness.

Similar in concept to a synthmask, a biomask is a layer of organic tissue and organs that are applied to the outside of a synthmorph.
Current-gen biomasks don't offer many advantages over conventional, synthetic tissue synth-masks; the main benefit is to authenticists who want their morphs to include some of the actual biology of the animal their 'sona is based on (although biomasks are obviously transgenic).

Plans for future development are ambitious, however.
Some groups want to integrate small digestive tracts; these could be integrated with the synth's systems, and would allow the biomask's metabolism to provide power to the synth.
Even more ambitiously, some hope to eventually integrate a partially-working reproductive system, allowing biomasked synths to carry pregnancies to term (although generating a viable genome and an ova are still at least a decade away; at present, embryos would need to be produced via in-vitro fertilization).

### Frame Adjusting

A more limited form of shape-changing technology, *frame-adjusting* morphs or gear use "conventional" materials and flexible construction (reconfigurable skeletons, hyperflexible joints, and so on) instead of meta-materials to achieve their effect.

The major downside is that the range of configurations that they can assume is typically far more limited.
Wheres proper shape-adjusting morphs can achieve dramatic changes in configuration, frame-adjusting morphs and gear can switch only between the few configurations that they are designed for.
There are two significant upsides, however: frame-adjusting morphs are significantly cheaper, and they can often adjust their shapes much more quickly (typically as a quick action).
Especially skilled operators can even adjust their morph's frames as part of other movements (adjust as free action while taking an action to move; imposes a -10 *distraction* penalty to all actions 'till start of next turn).

- Type: Gear (cyberware)
- Available: Common \[Medium\]

### Fursuit

Many furries do not want to radically modify themselves, do not want to present themselves as furries full-time, cannot afford a new morph, or otherwise do not wish to sleeve a furry morph.
Fursuits are still a common form of expression for many furries.

Among many of the more transhuman societies, fursuits tend to be (technologically) simple garments.
Modern blueprints support a wide range of creatures and customizations, making simple fursuits trivially available throughout Mars, Venus, and the outer system, while many artists create custom suits in a wide variety of styles and configurations for those who value the personal touch (or the status hit from having a bespoke suit).

Among more bioconservative societies, the best fursuits can be surprisingly sophisticated.
Some of the best suits manufactured in the Lunar-LaGrange Alliance include smart-matter materials and rival the capabilities of smart-matter vacsuits, while some of the most sophisticated suits produced in the Jovian Republic bio-engineered components and cybernetic interfaces, allowing the wearer to experience an entirely different body (if only in a limited way) without requiring them to actually resleeve.

- Type: Gear
- Fursuits are a common form of expression in the furry community.  The simplest are just garments made of modern materials; many blueprints, both open-source and proprietary, are commonly available.
  - Available: Common \[Trivial\]
- *Smart-matter fursuits* can reconfigure themselves to represent nearly any animal or design (constrained by the wearer's build).  Additionally, they have all the capabilities of *smart clothing* (*Eclipse Phase*: *Everyday Technology* section in *Gear* chapter).
  - Available: Furry Subculture \[Medium\]
- Similar to a *fur coat* (*Eclipse Phase*: *Pets* section in *Gear* chapter), *Bioengineered* fursuits use real, organic tissue in their construction.
  - Available: Furry Subculture \[Low\]
- The most sophisticated bioengineered suits include cybernetic interfaces, allowing them integrate with the wearer's body and sensorium, and allowing the wearer to control them.  Of course, these require the users to have appropriate cybernetic interfaces or other 'ware to function (including *access jacks* and/or a *cranial computer* for sensory integration).
  - Available: Furry Subculture \[Medium\]
- Many fursuits are custom constructions.  This can make a positive impression on communities that value art and artists, providing +10 to +30 on checks related to social interactions in those communities.
  - Available: Furry Subculture, increase cost category by one.
- Some fursuits integrate other 'ware, ranging from built-in tools to armor mods to cyberware or nanoware.  Allowable 'ware is at GM's discretion.  Treat as modifying a morph, bot, or gear.

### Furry Mod Pack

Furry mods exist for a number of common morphs, especially low- and midrange synthmorphs.
They are usually entirely cosmetic, although some may include sensory packages, claws, or other minor hardware.

- Type: Gear (cyberware)
- Includes: Synthetic Mask (if Synth), Bodysculpting, Tail, up to two Enhanced Senses, claws
- Available: Common \[Medium\]

### Gum

*Gum* is a meta-material designed to mimic a texture somewhere between rubber and flesh; the intent is to mimic a particular art style that was used in some early computer-generated animations.
It has subtle sub-surface lighting effects, like skin, but is typically smooth and hairless, a bit like rubber.

Much like a squishbot, synthmorphs equipped with gum cannot mount some robot frame upgrades – including armor mods, other exterior upgrades (like invisible metamaterials) and some propulsion systems (unless they are on retractable mounts).
However, also like squishbots, they can mount some upgrades only available to biomorphs, including *chameleon skin* and *bioweave armor*.
Biomorphs with Gum also benefit from slightly higher armor ratings; they gain +2E/+2K inherent armor (which stacks with any other armor mods they take, and any worn armor).

- Type: Gear (nanoware)
- Available: Furry Subculture \[Low\], Brony Subculture \[Low\]

### Holoskin

*Holoskin* consists of an array of holoprojectors positioned around a morph, which can be used to project a virtual image over its surface.
Among other things, this allows a morph to display any physical appearance its user desires – subject, of course, to that design fitting over the surface of the physical morph.

Unfortunately for Firewall, because holograms are only visible in the visual spectrum, holoskins are not particularly useful for impersonation or infiltration.
(Among other limitations; holograms are primarily emissive, for example, and so cannot cast shadows.)
Because they allow a morph to change its appearance at any time, they are popular with those who like to be able to adjust their appearance on the fly, or whose desired physical appearance is fantastical or difficult to achieve – notably including furries.

- Type: Gear (cyberwear)
- Available: Common \[Low\]

### Omnihands

Omnihands are *frame-adjusting* cyberware hands with the ability to assume several configurations.
Most can switch between hands (with one or two thumbs), hooves, or claws (like a crab's); changing configuration takes a *quick action*.

While omnihands do have practical uses, they were primarily developed to support furry, brony, fantasy, and similar subcultures, to allow morphs that do not normally have hands (ranging from ponies too dragons) to function in a society designed for transhuman hands.

- Type: Gear (cyberwear)
- Available: Furry Subculture \[Low\], Brony Subculture \[Low\]

## Morphs

### Fur

This morph is included for completeness; most furries do not sleeve furry morphs full-time.
While there are a few common mass-produced models available, *Furs* are  often bespoke productions; artists take common Synths and customize them according to the client's design.

Conventions with a physical-space component often keep a few of Furs on hand so that infomorph attendees can jam them as required; they typically include chameleon skin (or chameleon fur, as the case may be), smart tattoos, and other appearance-adjusting 'ware to allow their appearance to be easily adjusted.

- **Custom**: customized morphs (especially those produced by popular artists or artisans) can carry status and prestige (at least in some communities).
  - Add the *Bespoke Morph* trait
  - Availability: Character Creation (35 CP); Furry Subculture \[Expensive\]

### Lycan

The Lycan is a variant critter morph, designed to resemble a werewolf.
It is primarily aimed at horror and fantasy fans, and is available in several varieties, designed to mimic different varieties of werewolves from different sources.
(A tailless variant is particularly popular with fantasy ARG players.)

Unfortunately, the morph is a conventional transgenic pod, and so it is not capable of *transforming* like the werewolves of legend.

The morph is restricted on some habitats, because of its enhanced musculature and claws.

- Available: Character Creation (20 CP); grown morphs are \[Expensive\]

### Neko

The Neko adds cat-like physical features to a gene-fixed human morph.

The morph is not designed for the furry subculture *per se*.
Instead, it is mainly intended for anime fans.

The morph is being developed using a patronage model.
Those who fund the project can make and vote on feature requests, but the resultant genetics are ultimately released under an open license.
The principle developer is located on New Pittsburgh, a small Extropian hab in the main belt; the project includes other developers scattered throughout the 'Belt.

The morphs are highly configurable, with many cosmetic options available.
Options for fur coverage include whole body, "underwear", tops, bottoms, and none; there are dozens of fur colors; tails and cat ears can be toggled; and both human and feline facial structures are supported.
The coding behind these features is sophisticated; most are controlled by a few SNPs, so that they are easy to control and select for.
Care has also been taken to ensure that the morphs are genetically compatible with the baseline human genome – flats and splicers.
Gene drives have been used to ensure that the extra bits of genetic coding necessary for Nekos will always be passed on.

- Available: Character Creation (20 CP); genetics are available for free, grown morphs are \[Expensive\]

### Orion

Orions are flexible, shape-changing morphs designed for combat duty.
The morphs were designed on the Welsh Death-Sphere, a furry habitat in the outer belt.
The goal was to produce a morph for their habitat's defense volunteers; it needed to have a usable combat profile, to be cheap enough for the small habitat to be able to design and produce it, and to be able to easily be configured to represent different user's fursonas.

The Orion features a flexible frame, heavy armor, light weapons, and holoskin.
The flexible frame and holoskin give it a remarkable ability to represent a wide range of characters, while the the heavy armor and sturdy frame make it quite tough for its size, and the included weaponry give the morph a usable offensive profile.

Physically, the Orion resembles a four-pointed star, with one limb attached to each point.
The Orion's frame is adjustable; it can adjust the separation and angle of the "points," allowing it to become taller or shorter, wider or narrower.
Many users will arrange it into a roughly humanoid layout, with two points server as shoulders and two as hips; they will then use the holoskin to project whatever character over it they wish.

- Type: Morph (Synth)
- Layout: Humanoid
- Movements: Walking 4/20
- Size: Medium
- Armor: 23E/23K w/ 'ware
- Durability / Wound Threshold: 40 / 8 (45/9 w/ 'ware)
- Advantages: *Synthmorph traits*, Frame Adjusting, Inherent Armor (7E/7K), +5 COO, +5 REF, +5 SOM (+10 w/ 'ware), +5 to one attribute of the player's choice
- Aptitude Maximum: 30
- Disadvantages: None
- 'Ware: 360-degree Vision, Access Jacks (Optional), Anti-Glare, Basic Mesh Inserts, Chameleon Skin, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Enhanced Hearing, Enhanced Vision, Hand Laser (4, one per limb), Hardened Skeleton (+5 DUR, +5 SOM), Heavy Combat Armor (16E/16K), Holoskin, Mnemonic Augmentation, Omnihands (4, one on each limb), T-Ray Emitter, Weapon Mount (internal, fixed)
- Available: Furry Subculture \[Expensive, minimum 45,000\]

### P1E

P1Es (pronounced "pony") are synthmorphs developed by the brony community.
A bit like furries, bronies have a strong maker culture; the P1E is developed as an open-source project, and at this point the design is fairly mature.
Being open-source, the morph is also available in a dizzying array of configurations – including, amusingly, a few targeted at gatecrashers and terraformers, who value the morph for being a cheap, well-constructed quadrupedal synthmorph.
(The quadrupedal construction makes them well-adapted to difficult terrain and heavy loads.)

- Type: Morph (Synth)
- Layout: Horse-like (~130cm high at shoulder)
- Movements: Walking 4/20/40
- Size: Medium
- Armor: Inherent Armor 6E/6K
- Durability / Wound Threshold: 40 / 8
- Advantages: *Synthmorph traits*, +5 SOM, +5 to one other aptitude of the player's choice
- Aptitude Maximum: 30
- Disadvantages: Lacks Manipulators, Social Stigma (Synth), Social Stigma (Unusual Subculture)
- 'Ware: Access Jacks (Optional), Basic Mesh Inserts, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Mnemonic Augmentation,
- Available: Character Creation (30 CP); blueprints are open-source; Brony Subculture \[High\]

Variants:

- **Crasher**: A variant developed by the gatecrasher community.  One significant change was redesigning the exterior of the morph, to make its origins less obvious.
  - Add Bodysculpting (angular plating), Enhanced Vision, *Extra Batteries*, Extra Limbs (2, arms, attached at shoulders), Fixers, Hardened Skeleton (+5 DUR, +5 SOM), Light Combat Armor (+14E/+12K), Nanophages, Nuclear Battery, Radio Booster, T-Ray Emitter
  - Remove Lacks Manipulators trait, Social Stigma (Unusual Subculture) trait
  - Available: Character Creation (30CP); Gatecrashers for \[Expensive\] (Minimum 30,000)
- **Gummy**: A variant that uses a nano-tissue coating to mimic a kind of flesh.  Gummies often include chromatophores in the skin to allow users to easily customize the morph to their character's design.
  - Add Chameleon Skin, *Gum*
  - Reduce inherent armor bonus to 2/2
  - Available: unchanged
- **Industrial**: A variant mainly targeted at the maker-nomads and teraformer line-crews of the Martian outback, the Industrial model is much tougher.
  - Add Bodysculpting (angular plating, optional), Electrical Sense, Enhanced Vision, *Extra Batteries*, Extra Limbs (2, arms, attached at shoulders), Hardened Skeleton (+5 DUR, +5 SOM), Industrial Armor (+10E/+10K), Pneumatic Limbs, Radio Booster, T-Ray Emitter, X-Ray Emitter
  - Remove Lacks Manipulators trait, Social Stigma (Unusual Subculture) trait
  - Available: Character Creation (30CP); Gatecrashers for \[Expensive\] (Minimum 30,000)
- **Large**: A larger variant, developed becaus some characters from the show were larger than others.
  - Increase size to \[Large\], Increase DUR to 55.
  - Available: unchanged
- **Pegasus**: Pegasi add wings to the morph.  Unfortunately, the physics of the real world are not as conducive to flight as either children's cartoons or Greek myth; Pegasi fare well in low gravity and microgravity, but struggle in more than a third of a G.  In order to improve flight capabilities, users sometimes add other propulsion systems; ionic air propulsion is a common choice, because they can be directly integrated into the wings.  However, in order to provide any practical benefit, extensive changes to the morph and wings are required.
  - Add the Winged (2/10/30) movement mode; profile is given for Mars, and should be adjusted for other environments.
  - Available: unchanged
