### Electrically-Steered Microwave Weapons

Electrically-steered microwave weapons are large arrays of microwave emitters.
They operate using the same principles as an *advanced electrically-steered array (AESA) radar*; pairs of emitters activate at the same frequency but slightly shifted phase; this allows them to control the interference pattern, which in turn can be used to construct a "virtual" microwave beam.
One advantage of forming a beam this way is that the beam can be cast in any desired direction almost instantly -- without requiring the emitter to be physically moved.
Another is that the array can be use many different elements for different purposes, ranging from detection (as RADAR) to attack (as a microwave weapon) to communication (as a microwave transceiver).

These weapons are also sometimes called "\[Microwave\] Drone Defense Systems," because they were originally designed to defend against drone swarms.

Some arrays also mix emitters at other frequencies; this can allow them to also communicate in some radio bands, for example -- although usually at a cost in bulk (making the system larger) or capability (replacing some microwave emitters, loosing some microwave capabilities).

With their large array of independent emitters, they can be used to perform a variety of functions simultaneously: they can function as a combat radar, tracking multiple targets; cast higher-energy microwave beams, serving as a weapon (using the rules for beam weapons); and can be used for communication (as a microwave transceiver).
In general, only some of the emitters are capable of emitting at the higher energy levels needed for "target disruption."
The table below lists the profiles for various versions of the weapon, including the number of attacks, attack damage, and the number of targets it can track.

Notably, both heat and battery life can be concerns for ESMWs.
Despite the extremely high efficiencies of modern electrical and photo-electrical systems, drawing and radiating enough energy to fry several drones at once produces a large amount of heat.
Similar to a plasma cannon, these weapons are only capable of making a certain number of attacks before they must be given one full turn of cooldown.
An operator who fires in excess of this -- by overriding the weapons safeties, hacking it, activating emergency directives, or otherwise defeating whatever control system it uses -- risks damaging or disabling the weapon its power system.

A final note is that the "virtual beams" are not true, focussed beams; they have a more complex emission pattern, including side lobes -- regions off to the side of the area they are being focussed on, that still receive significant radiation.
Those trained to use the system are usually taught to avoid these areas, but they are still dangerous and can be hazardous to those who do not understand how the system operates.
(*Most* ESMW control systems have will attempt to warn users if an obstruction is detected in a side lobe; of course, not everyone will understand the warnings, or care.)

| Weapon | Attacks per Action | Attack Bonus | Damage | Range | Attack Actions Before Cooldown | Tracking Targets |
| ---    | ---                | ---          | ---    | ---   | ---                            | ---              |

### Golden Deer (Ultimates)

These deceptively elegant robots are deployed by the Ultimates to support their transhuman infantry.
They are named for their vague resemblance to (headless) deer: they are quadrupedal, with a tall (190cm at the shoulder, 220 at the center of the back) and slender build, and powerful hind legs designed for speed.
They have mounts along the top and side, which allow them to be configured for a variety of different missions.

The Ultimate force on Apsu is mainly composed of transhuman infantry, equipped with combat armor or battlesuits.
While these forces are formidable, their numbers are not large, and there are combat roles that they are not equipped to fill.
They use Golden Deer to supplement these forces, filling out their ranks, carrying extra supplies, and carrying mission equipment that transhuman infantry cannot easily carry.

The Ultimates fought against many of the bots and war machines of the armies of old-Earth nations during the Fall; this makes them highly skeptical of their 'bot companions.
The Ultimates have expended substantial resources making the *Golden Deer* resistant to both nanowarfare and infosec attacks.
Notably, this include a *hardware spiking nueral network*, which implements much of the bots' ALI.
Much like the partial biological nervous tissue in a pod, this hardware SNN cannot be hacked -- at least, not by compromising the bots' digital control systems -- which makes infosec attacks on the bots more difficult.
(It remains to be seen whether this will pose any significant challenge to the TITANs.)

The Ultimates equip these bots with a wide variety of combat systems, depending on their mission.

### Infiltrator (Vanguard)

The Vanguard are developing these small 'bots to infiltrate enemy habitats -- 

### Light Weapon Carriers

A class of bots rather than a discrete design, Light Weapons Carriers are small robots used to carry infantry and soldier-portable weapons systems.
Most designs resemble small tanks; small chassis 225cm long and 130cm, often weighing in the range of 200kg-500kg, often tracked, and equipped with a turret on top.

Different fighting forces use LWCs in a variety of configurations, and employ them in a variety of roles.
Some deploy them in squads and use them as primary combatants, replacing transhuman infantry in most roles; others use them as support elements, mixing transhumans, LWCs, and other bots.

LWCs come in a wide variety of configurations; the below profile is a median, and should be adjusted to fit the scenario, representing different factions or configurations.

- Type: Bot
- Layout: Tank-like (tracked, with turret)

- Available: generally available for \[High\], except were restricted
  - On Apsu: Apsu League for \[Medium\], but regulated; Bonaventure for \[Medium\], but regulated; Produced by Vanguard, but only available internally.

- Skills: Hardware: Armorer 30, Infiltration 30, Interest: Small Squad Tactics 60, Interfacing 30, Perception 40, Pilot: Groundcraft \[Tracked\] 40, Gunnery 40

On Apsu, LWCs are deployed in large numbers by Apsu Vanguard, who use them as a primary combat element rather than infantry or anthroform 'bots; and in smaller numbers by Bonaventure and Apsu League, who use them in primarily defensive roles, and to supplement other combat elements.

- Apsu Vanguard: the Vanguard produces LWCs in large numbers relative to their population, equip them with a variety of weapons, and deploy them in most combat roles.  They are slightly lighter (to control costs), but also quicker and longer-ranged (to support offensive deployment).
  - Variant changes: subtract 5 DUR, 1 WT; add *extra battery*, increase speed to 4/20/45
  - Common mounts: light autocannon; seeker batteries (8 minimissiles or 4 standard missiles); machinegun (as described in CRB, but fed by belt from internal magazine; 200 round capacity); mortar
  - Experimental mounts: Drone Defense System; combat radar (AESA); optical tracking suite (IRST, Viewer, Laser Rangefinder/Designator)
- Apsu League and Bonaventure: produced in smaller numbers (relative to force size), the League and Bonaventure use LWCs in a mainly defensive role, typically in combined-arms units beside other bots, vehicles, or transuhman infantry.
  - Variant changes: replace Light Combat Armor with Heavy Combat Armor (+16E/+16K)
  - Common mounts: light autocannon; seeker batteries (8 minimissiles or 4 standard missiles); machinegun (as described in CRB, but fed by belt from internal magazine; 200 round capacity)
- Apsu League Police Special Forces: deployed to support their Police Special Forces, these LWCs are equipped to handle long-duration deployments and serve every role from hauling equipment to clearing mines
  - Variant changes: add *nuclear battery*, *t-ray emitter*, fixers, chemical sniffer
  - Common mounts: laser pulser

### Vanguard Anti-Drone Platform

The Vanguard brought these vehicles from Sol; they are specialized anti-drone weapons platforms.
They carry Drone Defense Systems, which consist of large arrays of microwave emitters; loosely, these arrays use a technology similar to beamforming to instantly cast microwave beams in different directions.
Depending on factors such as energy, precise frequency, and collumation, these beams can be used for detection (like radar), as a weapon (like a microwave agonizer), or even for communication (as a microwave link).

Apsu Vanguard have three of these vehicles.
Two are equipped with standard Drone Defense Systems, while the third is equipped with an enhanced system.
