  - Carbon Compact: 8.5K + 4K
- Total: 600K approx

centrigrav:

- Let's keep the target of 0.2G on the Thistledown floor.
- Dimensions:
  - Originally: "the asteroid is almost 30km long and 9km in radius at the widest, but the Cavern is only 15km long, and 4.5km in radius."
  - Now: "43km long (along its major axis) and 23km in diameter"
  - Let's assume the Thistledown cavern is 11km in radius and 25km long.
- So, assuming r=11km and fg=0.2G, that's…
  - that gives us an *angular* velocity of 0.1275rpm, and a *tangential* velocity of 146.88m/s (which is… holy shit, 529.2 km/h).
  - Some back-of-the-envelope math says that might be about right for 0.1-ish RPM.
- If we step down to 0.1G, that'd give us 0.09rpm and 103.9m/s tangential.
  Which is 375km/h.
- And if we use 0.1275rpm and zoom out to 23km radius (at the surface), that's… 0.42G and 307.1 m/s angular.
  - Which is a whopping 1105.56 km/s.
- I'm not thrilled with how this math is working.
  In particular, it makes the cooperative kind of pricks if they spin to a comfy 0.2G *for them* even though they're not even half-way to the surface.
  - So I may turn those radii down a little.
  - Let's try 35km long/10km radius for the rock, and 20kmlong/7km radius
  - oh hey, actually, the old numbers probably wouldn't work, because I said "radius" for one and "diameter" for the other.
  - that gives us: 0.16rpm, 117m/s on the chamber floor, and 0.286G / 167.6m/s on the surface.
  - I like that better; they're not crushing the guys on the rim and breaking up the rock at that point.
  - (that's 421.2 km/h at the chamber floor)
  - also that's 0.22G in the Loop.

Notably for Infinite Loop, the [Shanghai Maglev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_maglev_train) ([maglevs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev)) can cover a distance of 30.5 km in 8 minutes at about 430km/h-ish.
So the bounce-train might still work in some form.
If we assume the bounce-train runs much more slowly -- around 200km/h -- and if we assume that the bounce-train track is a little wider than the Thistledown chamber, about 8km, then we get:

- linear velocity at train floor: 0.23G, 134m/s → 482.4km/h.
- adjusted "high-grav": about 680 kph ballpark → 190m/s ballpark → 0.46G
- *Oh hey, that calc can just change the units.  God dammit.*
- adjusted "low-grav": about 280 kph ballpark → 0.077G.

# The Old Text I'm Slicing From

Kainouda 2035 is an asteroid colony in the main belt.  It was originally an Extropian project: it was claimed by the Kainouda 2035 Development Company, which then sold shares of it to other parties, chiefly Extropians, for development.  Over time, several mutualist co-ops conglomerated, and their combined territory came to cover most of the rock; they then reorganized themselves into a direct-democratic polity.  Even though the vast majority of the Thistledown is controlled by that cooperative, it is still technically owned by the Kainouda Development Company, and that company remains the major forum for “whole asteroid” affairs.  Substantial parts of the Thistledown are still owned and occupied by Extropians, most notably the space-port; there is also a small Hypercorp presence, centered around Infinite Loop, a series of small warrens connected by a tram.  The Thistledown is a major outpost for the rare breed of Hypercorp that seeks to maintain a good relationship with either outer-system Anarchists or Titanians.
The asteroid also has a small warren of Objectivists, who are performing experimental psychosurgery on themselves.  Minerva is part of a team of psychologists who are studying the collapse of social order in that burrow.
The Thistledown is one of the few “Reagan Cylinders” outside of the Jovian system – the locals prefer to call it a Bear Cylinder or Bear Colony.  The asteroid has a hollow cavity running through it, and it has been spun to provide gravity; this cavity was constructed by the Thistledown Commonwealth, and is their major territory.  Unlike most Reagan Cylinders, the Thistledown Cavern takes up only a part of the volume of Kainouda 2035: the asteroid is almost 30km long and 9km in radius at the widest, but the Cavern is only 15km long, and 4.5km in radius.  This is largely because the Cavern is surrounded by burrows and habitats that the Thistledown Commonwealth does not control.  The asteroid is only spun to 0.2G gravity, largely because of the presence of those burrows – both because they weaken the cavern floor, and because the early burrows were not designed to bear up under gravity.
While they are not directly associated with the asteroid, there are four cluster habitats located near it – less than a hundred kilometers away, in fact.  These habitats have a population of roughly one-thousand each.  They were built by the populace of Kainouda 2035 during the fall to house infugees.  Since they are populated by infugees form Earth, most of them are nominally run as transitional economies, along standard Hypercorp lines.  However, since they were built quickly to host evacuees, they generally do not have the resources or facilities to run a transitional economy, and so three of the four habitats remain “stalled”.  Formal government has collapsed on the fourth, and it is now a Scum habitat.
You were on Kainouda 2035 very briefly at the beginning of Chapter 3; it was not described in detail at that time.  This is where Yellow Dog Imports is located; YDI is the company that Miguel D'Icaza runs.  Miguel, in turn, was the Proxy you met at the start of Chapter 3, before you were sent to the Wildfire facility for the real briefing.  (That was a complex chapter.)  Miguel was also the person who sent CV, Misandry and Pills to Titan during one of the one-shot arcs; however, as they ego-cast in, the asteroid was once again not described.
Your team returned to the asteroid for Chapter 9, when you were tasked with tracking down Henry Markram, who was believed to have gone there aboard the Black Jack Davey.  In Chapter 9, it was described in much greater detail.
The Thistledown Commonwealth also funds several other projects.  They host an Argonaut library inside the Cavern itself – although the Argonauts also have an independently-held burrow elsewhere on the asteroid.  The Thistledown Cooperative funds the Thistledown Open Culture Center, an umbrella operation that runs several smaller groups, including a museum, an art gallery and an Argonaut-style open exchange for several disciplines of what we would today call the humanities.

Kainouda 2035 and The Thistledown
    • Kainouda 2035 has 700K people living on it
    • Thistledown Cavern itself houses half of that – 450 thousand people
        ◦ that cavern is 35km long and 8km wide, give or take – check those numbers, or edit Program document.
        ◦ Original program document: 15km long, 6km wide, cavern 4.5km high.  Spun to 0.2G (make that less?)
        ◦ Cavern is internal – it has no end-cap access.
        ◦ Extropians manage the Spaceport at one end, and smaller Extropian warrens have deliberately resisted cavern expansion on the other end, out of spite.
        ◦ It has a light-tube above, which also includes some built-up regions (but small)
            ▪ think that's above cloud layer
    • History
        ◦ bought by Kainouda 2035 Development Company in BF20+
        ◦ leased-in-perpetuity to Extropians
        ◦ Mutualists grew faster than Capitolists, cooperated better, built better infrastructure
        ◦ Bad Years, when most capitolists left, remainder fought with Mutualists and lost
        ◦ Mutualist concerns form Thistledown Cooperative, a Market-Socialist state a little like Titan (or Belt-Con)
        ◦ people vote → set state policy → administer public concerns (banks)
        ◦ capitols and resources go to individuals as long as used productively, goods exchanged on open market
            ▪ bank-mediated exchange can sell goods outside of Mutualist enclave (e.g. to Capitolists)
            ▪ individuals get labor product, all capitol owned by banks (which are organs of state)
        ◦ people vote → set policy → policy works banks → banks and policy work tier-two public co-ops → other services provided by market exchange
        ◦ all citizens get autonomist-lifestyle-worth from Banks/community
        ◦ other groups still present, Extropians run spaceport, hypercorps run Infinite Loop, other small warrens
    • present nearby:
        ◦ several <1K cluster habs, built to house infugees during the Fall
        ◦ it is disputed whether they're Scum or Consortium

Thistledown Ideas
    • central cavern is not divided into chambers, like actual Thistledown
    • cavern floor divided into “modules”, with some modules grouped into districts
    • Some irregular mountains, where they couldn't get around existing construction
    • laid out a little like Gerlach
        ◦ a few large “cities” or “districts” with high buildings clustered tightly together, people densely packed
            ▪ “stretching up half the heigh of the chamber”, about 2km high
        ◦ large stretches of greenery
        ◦ a few smaller “towns”
        ◦ terraced in some places, like a park
        ◦ vertiginous, with different things on top of and under each other (e.g. “park blocks” with living and working space under them)
            ▪ freerunning especially popular
        ◦ trenches of through-way, shop and residence in the walls below park sections
    • Point of interest: Thistledown Open Culture Center
        ◦ houses ampitheaters and stages
        ◦ hosts servers for “arxiv/argonaut – style” peer-reviewed open exchange of history papers
        ◦ aiming to be second-best location for the humanities, outside of Titan
        ◦ at the heart of “Kerouac City” (technically, Kerouac Metro Area, spanning several modules with their own names)
    • Point of Interest: the Lonely Mountain
        ◦ complex of Extropian warrens above what would have been the chamber floor
        ◦ two forrest modules on either side, a river connecting the two, cut below the warrens
        ◦ inside the mountain, at cavern floor level, Proudhon Mutual Market, where market socialists and anarco-capitolists exchange
    • Axis City,  small installation on the axis itself
        ◦ public space and public facilities
        ◦ Seat of thistledown's education or sciences?
Other sites on Kainouda
    • The Spaceport, controlled by Extropians, and the Kainouda Tourist Company
    • The Infinite Loop, administered by a Hypercorp Conglomerate
        ◦ where Yellow Dog Imports is located, among others
        ◦ three large warrens roughly equally distributed around a slice of the asteroid
        ◦ forward, before Thistledown Cavern opens, behind the spaceport
        ◦ a literal loop that the tram runs over, that also has stops at some small Extropian warrans, some minor hypercorp habs, and a few “hole-in-the-wall” habs
    • large parts are strung together by different tram lines
        ◦ there's one running “beneath” the cavern floor of Thistledown Cavern, which junctures to the independent one that serves the Infinite Loop, and the independent one that serves the Spaceport (which is just as much an internal cargo-moving system)
    • Taggart Burrow, an Objectivist hold-out and major source of terrorist attacks
        ◦ conducts research into dangerous psycho-surgery
        ◦ other Extropians think of Objectivists the way everyone else thinks of Extropians, as dangerous and deluded sociopaths that no-one else really wants to deal with

Tentatively (re-)named one of the stations *Limehouse*, after the part of london where the opium dens where.

# Re-Working

## The Thistledown

I'd like to rethink this and make sure I've got it straight before I write it.

- Skimming some quick-links on Mutualism makes me less confident that it makes sense or means anything.
- It also sounds *very* libertarian; other than not liking rent or land-lords, and liking mutual-aide groups in principle, there isn't a huge difference.
- On the other hand, this is a future sci-fi setting, and we do get to write whatever we want, so… fuck it, more or less.
- The community-bank things do have attestation in at least one source, but they *also* don't make any sense, so … they will be interpreted loosely.
  - I'm thinking I might replace them with something like a member-owned cooperative structure that basically buys a habitat and uses a micro-currency for their internal dealings.
  - *That might be kind of thematically appropriate, because they're building a voluntary mutual-aide association inside an existing capitalist structure.*
  - And I guess they also allow external users to *optionally* use their micro-currency.
  - The question that still leaves me is how that community *expands*, because that's a necessary element to the plot.
  - And then webs of micro-corps and mutual-aide groups form around that, and then they merge.
- Stage one of the merger is agreeing to shift to one common micro-currency; this necessitates forming a "central bank" to manage it.
- Stage two of the merger is *some kind of tax-and-spend structure* forming, so that the cooperatives can keep building infrastructure.
  - And this is kind of a departure, because "What Is Mutualism" made it pretty clear that taxes *aren't* ok.
  - Although the EP version says that "community banks can charge interest."
  - And one of those web-sites did mention that "the monetary thinking \[in What is Mutualism\] is out of date."

## The Hypercorps

Who owns what, since I've written two sentences and written myself into answering that.

- The HyperConsortium buys the territory, but they're a shell-company.
- They're *probably* owned by OSI, and the other hypercorps who wanted to set up shop on the asteroid.
- In turn, they sublicensed to Infinite Loop and KHC Support (name?), and 
- OSI (and other hypercorp clients) are leasing space, but also partial owners of the company they're leasing from.

Thinking about this the other way, thinking about history, might help.

Who started this?
Did a hypercorp buy land for hope, did Infinite Loop have a specific plan, or did OSI want to do business here and kick the whole thing into motion?
I feel like oligarchs and owners probably had things in motion way before capital was purchased, so probably OSI — and maybe some other concerns — started putting feelers out.

Actually, that's a question: was OSI operating before, somewhere else, or was this their first digs?
Kind of like a lot of hypercorps — or maybe old-world corps — there probably was something, but they probably merged and acquired.
I need to be careful, though, because I want Raniere to be likable.

I don't want to spend a lot of time thinking about it; I have not been working effectively for the last hour or two.
I'm getting hung up on details that aren't important.

The Timeline:

- BF 21: Kainouda purchased
- BF 13: Thistledown Cooperative
- BF 9: Infinite Loop established (in anticipation of spin)
- BF 8: asteroid spun

From the book:

- A quick timeline is on CRB p.37.
  - "Argonauts split from hypercorps" and "Belt colonized" in BF 40-20.
- But also, on CRB p.57
  > Various forms of anarchism and similar libertarian ideologies were quite common among the first transhumans who settled space in the two decades before the Fall.
- While I'm at it, there's a concise description of Hypercorps on CRB p.70.
- From CRB p.79
  > Titan was originally settled in the late 21st century by a European academic consortium, making it the only major body in the system colonized primarily by non-hypercorp interests.
  - Notably, the write-up in that bloc doesn't exactly match what they've written later -- I don't think -- and it also doesn't make a lot of sense, because it's still assuming a primarily-rep economy.
- From Rimward p.16
  > The first ventures to the Main Belt for mining and habitat development were launched decades before the Fall. In addition to Earth corporations that staked their claims to mineral-rich asteroids, there were also plenty of rugged individualists and wealthy entrepreneurs who supported Earth’s expanding reach deeper into space.
  - That *loosely* ligns up with "BF 40-20" for the colonization of the main belt.
- From Sunward p.145:
  > Though thousands of hypercorps are full members of the Planetary Consortium—the business entity, that is—the vast majority have no actual voting power (outside of the Ministry) and hold no shares. That privilege is set aside for the Consortium’s founding members, who have changed little since its beginning a decade ago.
  - From Sunward p.145, the consortium used to be the *Offworld Consortium," but remade itself as the fall wrapped up (and apparently incorporated "Mars's terraforming infrastructure" and the U.N. at that point, lol).

Let's assume:

- Raniere was already *fairly* well-heeled, and might have had some independant small hypercorps doing what OSI was going to do.
- I want OSI to be reasonably big, but it also probably shouldn't be *that* old because that wouldn't line up with the history of the setting.
  - Or, after doing some re-reading, it kind of might.
- A quick call is that Raniere may have already headed up some short-torm operations and "corporate alliances" with the Outer System, and may already have run a few open-source micro-ops.
  - So he was already *somewhat* established when he started OSI proper in say BF 3.
- Arright, I've hit meta-done-with-it, so:
  - Raniere was a name in robotics and had run collaboration ops between BF 7-3
  - OSI is established in BF 3, and absorbed several of his previous operations.
  - OSI moves into its current digs in AF 2.
- So if Infinite Loop was founded in BF 9, it predates the Hypercorp Consortium *as such*.
- That also means that OSI is older than the Consortium itself.

In that case:

- It probably makes sense for something like KHC -- the Kainouda HyperConsortium -- to exist, but to exist mainly as a holding company.
  - Something for investers to own, to unite the work of other companies.
  - *It might work both ways: investers bought shares and invested in it to get it off the ground, but "client" companies may also have bought small shares in it so that they can be at least partial masters of their own fate.
    Or the *owners* of client companies may also be partial owners of KHC, that might make even more sense.
    - Like Carbine's line, this turns KHC into a weird kind of keiretsu.
  - Actually, if we wanted to lean more in that direction, we could have something more like a central bank, which the behind-the-scenes owners hold, and which then holds shares in basically everything in infinite loop.
  - Actually, one of the themes of the Consortium is "fast, flexible, and mean," so it might be fairly thematic for them to *not* invest in permanent interests in each-other.
  - So *infinite loop*, and perhaps an infrastructure hypercorp, might be two hypercorps that KHC owns, and that do all the actual work.
  - There might be a bunch more other hypercorps that are at least partly owned by the holding companies -- and these might be the smaller burrows.
- Looking at what these words actually *mean*:
  - So a consortium is a partnership of existing businesses.
    In that mold, you've got some existing companies that unite to colonise (a part of) an asteroid.
  - Whereas a holding company is "Alphabet" or "Meta", an entity that exists to own a bunch of smaller companies that actually Do Things, and their IP.
    So in that scenario, the holding company unites investors, and then shuffles businesses and assets around to create smaller companies that actually do work.
  - And then you've got the [keiretsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiretsu), which is a Japanese riff on the consortium that includes a (an informal?) hierarchy of control and cross-connecting reciprocal ownership.
    "with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings."
- One possibility is that it was originally a Consortium -- although that kind of requries large(?) pre-existing companies that had existing holdings or specific plans.
  - Which could work if some of the hypercorps are subsidiaries or projects of existing hypercorps.
  - and then OSI has the option of paying rent forever like a tenent, or blunting that effect by buying a chunk of KHC (at which point they'd be paying rent to themselves, indirectly through KHC).
- And the other option is that KHC is a holding company, IL et al. are companies they spawned for specific tasks, and OSI is just a tenant (without any ownership stake in the others).
  - and a variant of that is that KHC bought partial rights to a module, like a T3BE question on real property.
- Hmm.
  Thinking about it, I kind of like the idea that OSI has tied itself down more than hypercorps usually do, because they're constantly getting picked at by internal enemies who don't like their ties to the outer system.
  Like they have a need to "defend" themselves.
- Allright, so that's what I'm going with.
  - KHC is a holding company, with IL et al. as subsidiaries.
  - OSI was a tenant, but then they bought a stake in KHC itself, and they bought out their module.
  - (We'll say that happened early in AF 4.)
- Actually, since OSI isn't the only "odd tenant" of Infinite Loop, we might even say that that's a somewhat normal procedure -- "tenants" might buy-out a module, and might buy a partial stake in the KHC itself.
- OK, yeah, I like that.
  - "It's a little weird out here, because they're insulating themselves from their rivals and enemies."
  - It's kind of like joining the consortium; it's normal for "tenants" to buy partial owernship in the KHC itself.
  - And modules can be either rented or purchased.
