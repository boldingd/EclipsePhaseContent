# The Old Text I'm Slicing From

Kainouda 2035 is an asteroid colony in the main belt.  It was originally an Extropian project: it was claimed by the Kainouda 2035 Development Company, which then sold shares of it to other parties, chiefly Extropians, for development.  Over time, several mutualist co-ops conglomerated, and their combined territory came to cover most of the rock; they then reorganized themselves into a direct-democratic polity.  Even though the vast majority of the Thistledown is controlled by that cooperative, it is still technically owned by the Kainouda Development Company, and that company remains the major forum for “whole asteroid” affairs.  Substantial parts of the Thistledown are still owned and occupied by Extropians, most notably the space-port; there is also a small Hypercorp presence, centered around Infinite Loop, a series of small warrens connected by a tram.  The Thistledown is a major outpost for the rare breed of Hypercorp that seeks to maintain a good relationship with either outer-system Anarchists or Titanians.
The asteroid also has a small warren of Objectivists, who are performing experimental psychosurgery on themselves.  Minerva is part of a team of psychologists who are studying the collapse of social order in that burrow.
The Thistledown is one of the few “Reagan Cylinders” outside of the Jovian system – the locals prefer to call it a Bear Cylinder or Bear Colony.  The asteroid has a hollow cavity running through it, and it has been spun to provide gravity; this cavity was constructed by the Thistledown Commonwealth, and is their major territory.  Unlike most Reagan Cylinders, the Thistledown Cavern takes up only a part of the volume of Kainouda 2035: the asteroid is almost 30km long and 9km in radius at the widest, but the Cavern is only 15km long, and 4.5km in radius.  This is largely because the Cavern is surrounded by burrows and habitats that the Thistledown Commonwealth does not control.  The asteroid is only spun to 0.2G gravity, largely because of the presence of those burrows – both because they weaken the cavern floor, and because the early burrows were not designed to bear up under gravity.
While they are not directly associated with the asteroid, there are four cluster habitats located near it – less than a hundred kilometers away, in fact.  These habitats have a population of roughly one-thousand each.  They were built by the populace of Kainouda 2035 during the fall to house infugees.  Since they are populated by infugees form Earth, most of them are nominally run as transitional economies, along standard Hypercorp lines.  However, since they were built quickly to host evacuees, they generally do not have the resources or facilities to run a transitional economy, and so three of the four habitats remain “stalled”.  Formal government has collapsed on the fourth, and it is now a Scum habitat.
You were on Kainouda 2035 very briefly at the beginning of Chapter 3; it was not described in detail at that time.  This is where Yellow Dog Imports is located; YDI is the company that Miguel D'Icaza runs.  Miguel, in turn, was the Proxy you met at the start of Chapter 3, before you were sent to the Wildfire facility for the real briefing.  (That was a complex chapter.)  Miguel was also the person who sent CV, Misandry and Pills to Titan during one of the one-shot arcs; however, as they ego-cast in, the asteroid was once again not described.
Your team returned to the asteroid for Chapter 9, when you were tasked with tracking down Henry Markram, who was believed to have gone there aboard the Black Jack Davey.  In Chapter 9, it was described in much greater detail.
The Thistledown Commonwealth also funds several other projects.  They host an Argonaut library inside the Cavern itself – although the Argonauts also have an independently-held burrow elsewhere on the asteroid.  The Thistledown Cooperative funds the Thistledown Open Culture Center, an umbrella operation that runs several smaller groups, including a museum, an art gallery and an Argonaut-style open exchange for several disciplines of what we would today call the humanities.

Kainouda 2035 and The Thistledown
    • Kainouda 2035 has 700K people living on it
    • Thistledown Cavern itself houses half of that – 450 thousand people
        ◦ that cavern is 35km long and 8km wide, give or take – check those numbers, or edit Program document.
        ◦ Original program document: 15km long, 6km wide, cavern 4.5km high.  Spun to 0.2G (make that less?)
        ◦ Cavern is internal – it has no end-cap access.
        ◦ Extropians manage the Spaceport at one end, and smaller Extropian warrens have deliberately resisted cavern expansion on the other end, out of spite.
        ◦ It has a light-tube above, which also includes some built-up regions (but small)
            ▪ think that's above cloud layer
    • History
        ◦ bought by Kainouda 2035 Development Company in BF20+
        ◦ leased-in-perpetuity to Extropians
        ◦ Mutualists grew faster than Capitolists, cooperated better, built better infrastructure
        ◦ Bad Years, when most capitolists left, remainder fought with Mutualists and lost
        ◦ Mutualist concerns form Thistledown Cooperative, a Market-Socialist state a little like Titan (or Belt-Con)
        ◦ people vote → set state policy → administer public concerns (banks)
        ◦ capitols and resources go to individuals as long as used productively, goods exchanged on open market
            ▪ bank-mediated exchange can sell goods outside of Mutualist enclave (e.g. to Capitolists)
            ▪ individuals get labor product, all capitol owned by banks (which are organs of state)
        ◦ people vote → set policy → policy works banks → banks and policy work tier-two public co-ops → other services provided by market exchange
        ◦ all citizens get autonomist-lifestyle-worth from Banks/community
        ◦ other groups still present, Extropians run spaceport, hypercorps run Infinite Loop, other small warrens
    • present nearby:
        ◦ several <1K cluster habs, built to house infugees during the Fall
        ◦ it is disputed whether they're Scum or Consortium

Thistledown Ideas
    • central cavern is not divided into chambers, like actual Thistledown
    • cavern floor divided into “modules”, with some modules grouped into districts
    • Some irregular mountains, where they couldn't get around existing construction
    • laid out a little like Gerlach
        ◦ a few large “cities” or “districts” with high buildings clustered tightly together, people densely packed
            ▪ “stretching up half the heigh of the chamber”, about 2km high
        ◦ large stretches of greenery
        ◦ a few smaller “towns”
        ◦ terraced in some places, like a park
        ◦ vertiginous, with different things on top of and under each other (e.g. “park blocks” with living and working space under them)
            ▪ freerunning especially popular
        ◦ trenches of through-way, shop and residence in the walls below park sections
    • Point of interest: Thistledown Open Culture Center
        ◦ houses ampitheaters and stages
        ◦ hosts servers for “arxiv/argonaut – style” peer-reviewed open exchange of history papers
        ◦ aiming to be second-best location for the humanities, outside of Titan
        ◦ at the heart of “Kerouac City” (technically, Kerouac Metro Area, spanning several modules with their own names)
    • Point of Interest: the Lonely Mountain
        ◦ complex of Extropian warrens above what would have been the chamber floor
        ◦ two forrest modules on either side, a river connecting the two, cut below the warrens
        ◦ inside the mountain, at cavern floor level, Proudhon Mutual Market, where market socialists and anarco-capitolists exchange
    • Axis City,  small installation on the axis itself
        ◦ public space and public facilities
        ◦ Seat of thistledown's education or sciences?
Other sites on Kainouda
    • The Spaceport, controlled by Extropians, and the Kainouda Tourist Company
    • The Infinite Loop, administered by a Hypercorp Conglomerate
        ◦ where Yellow Dog Imports is located, among others
        ◦ three large warrens roughly equally distributed around a slice of the asteroid
        ◦ forward, before Thistledown Cavern opens, behind the spaceport
        ◦ a literal loop that the tram runs over, that also has stops at some small Extropian warrans, some minor hypercorp habs, and a few “hole-in-the-wall” habs
    • large parts are strung together by different tram lines
        ◦ there's one running “beneath” the cavern floor of Thistledown Cavern, which junctures to the independent one that serves the Infinite Loop, and the independent one that serves the Spaceport (which is just as much an internal cargo-moving system)
    • Taggart Burrow, an Objectivist hold-out and major source of terrorist attacks
        ◦ conducts research into dangerous psycho-surgery
        ◦ other Extropians think of Objectivists the way everyone else thinks of Extropians, as dangerous and deluded sociopaths that no-one else really wants to deal with

Tentatively (re-)named one of the stations *Limehouse*, after the part of london where the opium dens where.

# Re-Working

## The Thistledown

I'd like to rethink this and make sure I've got it straight before I write it.

- Skimming some quick-links on Mutualism makes me less confident that it makes sense or means anything.
- It also sounds *very* libertarian; other than not liking rent or land-lords, and liking mutual-aide groups in principle, there isn't a huge difference.
- On the other hand, this is a future sci-fi setting, and we do get to write whatever we want, so… fuck it, more or less.
- The community-bank things do have attestation in at least one source, but they *also* don't make any sense, so … they will be interpreted loosely.
  - I'm thinking I might replace them with something like a member-owned cooperative structure that basically buys a habitat and uses a micro-currency for their internal dealings.
  - *That might be kind of thematically appropriate, because they're building a voluntary mutual-aide association inside an existing capitalist structure.*
  - And I guess they also allow external users to *optionally* use their micro-currency.
  - The question that still leaves me is how that community *expands*, because that's a necessary element to the plot.
  - And then webs of micro-corps and mutual-aide groups form around that, and then they merge.
- Stage one of the merger is agreeing to shift to one common micro-currency; this necessitates forming a "central bank" to manage it.
- Stage two of the merger is *some kind of tax-and-spend structure* forming, so that the cooperatives can keep building infrastructure.
  - And this is kind of a departure, because "What Is Mutualism" made it pretty clear that taxes *aren't* ok.
  - Although the EP version says that "community banks can charge interest."
  - And one of those web-sites did mention that "the monetary thinking \[in What is Mutualism\] is out of date."

## The Hypercorps

Who owns what, since I've written two sentences and written myself into answering that.

- The HyperConsortium buys the territory, but they're a shell-company.
- They're *probably* owned by OSI, and the other hypercorps who wanted to set up shop on the asteroid.
- In turn, they sublicensed to Infinite Loop and KHC Support (name?), and 
- OSI (and other hypercorp clients) are leasing space, but also partial owners of the company they're leasing from.

Thinking about this the other way, thinking about history, might help.

Who started this?
Did a hypercorp buy land for hope, did Infinite Loop have a specific plan, or did OSI want to do business here and kick the whole thing into motion?
I feel like oligarchs and owners probably had things in motion way before capital was purchased, so probably OSI — and maybe some other concerns — started putting feelers out.

Actually, that's a question: was OSI operating before, somewhere else, or was this their first digs?
Kind of like a lot of hypercorps — or maybe old-world coprs — there probably was something, but they probably merged and acquired.
