# Thingvellir

Thingvellir (sometimes written as Þingvellir) is an Autonomist-aligned habitat in the [Jovian Hildas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_asteroid).
The habitat is dug into a roughly-spherical D-type asteroid about 45km in diameter; while it has substantial beehive tunnels and caverns, it also features several large centrigrav tracks.
All told, the asteroid has a population of roughly 250,000 people.

The Althing is known in part for its particular anarchist scheme, which is loosely inspired by the old-earth Althing of medieval Iceland (which some hail as an early example of a functioning anarchist society).

## History

The asteroid was claimed and developed by *Project Viking*, a cooperative with members hailing from the United States, Brazil, and northern Europe.
While their social-organization scheme was (and is) more closely-aligned with outer-system Autonomist habitats, they regarded themselves at the time as Extropian market-socialists, and their plans for the development of the asteroid where similar to those other Extropian groups had used elsewhere in the main belt.

The asteroid that would become Thingvellir was first surveyed robotically in BF 19, with the first outposts arriving in late BF 17 and the first permanent human occupants arriving in BF 16.
This was followed by a period of heavy mining, which served both to excavate caverns and tunnels in the rock, and to provide resources both for future use and for sale.
Then, starting in BF 14, construction of secondary civilian infrastructure began, and the members of Project Viking began to move to the habitat.
By BF 10, industrial activity on the asteroid had shifted mainly to civil infrastructure and habitat construction, and a secondary civilian industry had become established; immigration to the asteroid was then opened to all.

Thingvellir accepted refugees during the fall, both embodied and not.
Besides a notable increase in the rock's population (and a dramatic spike in the percentage of the population running as infomorphs), this also gave Thingvellir its main secondary habitat, the Longship.

In the wake of the Fall, Thingvellir was quick to join the Autonomist Alliance.
Over the following years, though their political and economic systems have not changed, Thingvellir has strengthened its ties with the outer system, and drifted away from the Extropian movement – although the community's ties to their fellow travelers among Extropian Mutualists and Market-Socialist circles remain strong.

## Governance

Thingvellir uses an anarchist scheme centered around a public assembly called the Althing.
The community – identified interchangeably with the Althing, as all members of the community are equal members of the assembly – owns the asteroid, the natural resources extracted from it, the major infrastructure (such as the habitat's major modules, it's power systems, and its life-support systems), and several public facilities (including several public makers and healing vats).
Of the resources extracted from the asteroid, a portion is held in reserve, some are sold in bulk to outside interests, and the remainder is distributed among the community's members.
However, some things, including prioritization in public fabber queues or scarce feed-stock components, are purchased with the community's microcurrency, the Thingvellir Kroner (or TK).

Similar to other Extropian schemes, however, members of the community are also free to own their own private capital and resources, to cultivate them as they see fit, and to exchange with other community members (and the wider solar-system) on a *de facto* open market.
The exchanges can be made using TK; or based on gift, barter, or reputation (like other outer-system polities); or priced in other currencies (like Consortium Credits).
There is the notable limit that community-held resources (including things produced from community-held feedstock, or Thingvellir Kroner themselves) cannot be traded outside the community without dispensation from the Althing.

The Althing serves as both a legislature and a judiciary.
As a legislature, the Althing is bicameral, with an upper (representative) and lower (democratic) chamber.
The upper chamber consists of 38 seats: each of seven districts elects two seats; 12 are assigned proportionately to political parties; and another 12 are assigned randomly to Trusted Citizens.
The lower chamber, on the other hand, consists of a direct-democratic poling of the entire populace.
The judiciary function of the assembly is served by 5 judges, three of which are elected and two are randomly selected Trusted Citizens.

The Althing has no executive functions, notably including no law-enforcement agencies.
These functions are instead served by work-groups or crews, organized ad-hoc from volunteers and impacted citizens as tasks or issues arise.
Some duties can only be fulfilled by Trusted Citizens; notably, only Trusted Citizens can take responsibility for managing or maintaining an  important public resource (like a community-owned power system), and only Trusted Citizens can undertake some tasks in criminal investigations (like accessing a private residence or collecting forensic evidence form someone's morph).

This means that the laws and judgements of the Althing are not enforced by any particular agency or organization.
While operating according to the will of the Althing will make recruiting volunteers easier, it does not guarantee the enforcement of any particular outcome.

This has a particular impact on criminal justice.
The operation of cases and courts at the Althing notwithstanding,
