# The Drifter Federation

The Drifter Federation is a federal union of habs and clusters, for the purpose of constructing a network of cyclers.
The Federation was formerly founded in BF 35, with the first habitat being completed and launched into its cycling orbit (between Earth and Mars) in BF 24.
Other habitats came much more quickly; the Federation now consists of 21 member polities.
The last habitat to be launched into a cycling orbit was Fort Solitude, which was injected into a cycling orbit between Jupiter and Mars in October of AF 9.

The Federation is much smaller than it was originally intended to be.
The original intent was to construct interstellar transport networks (ITNs) – habitats in transfer orbits, efficiently transferring cargo between the orbits of major habitats and worlds – and thereby to become the dominant force in intra-system transport.
Unfortunately, a number of technological developments curtailed the need for such an ITN.
While a number of Federation habitats are in transfer orbits, and the Federation does make a profit in low-priority interstellar transport, the members of the Federation have had to diversify their local economies; some have done this more effectively than others.

Today, the Federation is a notable minor power in the solar-system.
With several member habs, in several different orbits and regions, they maintain connections to a number of different powers, habitats, and factions; several of their large habitats maintain diversified and productive local economies; and a small navy and a few caches of long-range weapons give them a credible defense profile.

> **Conjurer**: The Drifter's threat profile is minimal; our main concern is their cache of long-range fusion missiles, and they're hardly the only hab or faction who maintain fusion weapons for deterrence.
> Notably, we have a handful of Registers and Routers in the Drifter Federation; some servers run safehouses out of the Federation, while others skim resources from some of their smaller, more down-on-their-luck, or unmonitored habitats.

## Cyclers

The Drifter Federation was formed to construct a network of *cyclers*, with the intent of dominating intrasolar transport; in order to understand the Drifters, it's important to understand what a cycler is.
A *cycling orbit* is an orbit that regularly meets two (or more) other objects; cyclers are objects (spacecraft, satellites, habs, and so on) placed into a cycling orbit.
When we talk about cyclers and cycling orbits, we're usually talking about objects cycling between two planets or habs orbiting the sun; these cycling orbits are highly elliptical, and cross the orbits of the planets they're cycling between more than once.
Cycling orbits can be more complex than they might seem; for example, cycling orbits do not necessarily encounter a given planet (or other object) every time they cross that planet's orbit, which can mean that there can be "gaps in the schedule" – a given Earth-Mars cycling orbit might offer quick transit from Earth to Mars, for example, but slow transit from Mars to Earth.

Because cyclers regularly encounter different planets or habs while burning no fuel, it might seem like they hold out the prospect of free (albeit slow) intrasystem transit.
This is not actually the case, because cyclers do not slow or stop when they cross planetary orbits; spacecraft will still need to burn a significant amount of fuel to accelerate and match the cycler's orbit (when departing) or decelerate and enter the destination's orbit (when arriving).

They do, however, offer more *efficient* planetary transit.
When large habitats are placed in cycling orbits, they can provide travelers with life-support, food, radiation shielding, and so on; this means that spacecraft do not need to launch these things, can instead carry only payload.

Cyclers were of much greater interest in the early years of spaceflight.
In BG 100, or even BF 50, it was not obvious how many of the challenges of spaceflight would be solved, and cyclers seemed like they would be a very effective means of practical spaceflight – if not perhaps the only way to conceivably provide months or years of food and life-support.
Unfortunately for the federation, many modern technologies have rendered cyclers nearly obsolete.
These range from biomods (which lessen the need for gravity and radiation shielding) to fusion power (which make much faster powered orbits practical) to egocasting and nanofabrication (which have curbed the need to transport physical objects).

## History

The Drifter Federation's earliest origins lie more than 40 years before the Fall.
In BF 46, in anticipation of the growing importance of Mars, a loose consortium began to assemble, with the intention of constructing a fleet of Mars cyclers.
The consortium was diverse; it included a number of academics, several venture-capitalists, a number of private aerospace concerns, and several government space agencies in the US and Europe.

## The Federal Union

In principle, the Drifter Federation is structured much like many pre-Fall federal unions, as a limited union of member polities; in practice, given the physical isolation of individual habitats, the ability of the Federation to intervene in an individual habitat's affairs is limited, and the Federation operates like many of the system's other loose alliances.

Individual habitats remain sovereign; they cede only certain power to the Federation.
In return, the Federation accepts certain obligations to individual habitats.
The Federation pledges to ensure the "credible defense" of individual habitats, to provide assistance in emergencies, and to ensure the stability and prosperity of the Federation.
In return, individual habitats cede the ability to declare war individually, obligate themselves to honor the Federation's trade laws and restrictions, and pledge to provide their citizens with certain basic rights (notably including freedom of residence and movement within the Federation).

In practice, owing to the physical isolation of each habitat, the Federation meets many of its obligation indirectly.
While the Federation does have a small navy, defense is primarily provided via credible deterrent – the Federation maintains several caches of long-range fusion kinetic-energy weapons, capable of striking intra-solar targets and causing enough damage to cripple or destroy a target habitat.
Similarly, in most scenarios, the Federation could never reach a habitat in an emergency; instead, the Federation funds local backup and emergency systems, and maintains a redundant ego-casting network and distributed, redundant backups.
And the federation provides "stability and prosperity" by spending federal funds, and through a network of central banks that issue a federal "backbone" currency.
Because member habitats are physically isolated, their economies are almost entirely separate in practice; for that reason, each habitat manages their own economy, with their own currencies; no habitat uses the Federal currency as a primary means of exchange.
Instead, each habitat maintains a Federal bank, and that bank exchanges local currencies for Federal currency.
The Federal currency is then used as a means of exchange between banks and habitats.
This allows the Federation an ability to conduct some fiscal and monitary policy, without interfering with each individual habitats ability to manage their own fiscal affairs.
