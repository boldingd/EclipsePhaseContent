Notes on several interesting or useful alien races.

## Notes on the "Core" Aliens

### The ETI

### The Factors

### The Gate-Builders

## Share-Your-Fire

Share-Your-Fire are a sophisticated, migratory civilization.
In some ways, they're very similar to (one interpretation of) the Factors — except they're much more forthright.
They can be a very disruptive influence, and can turn the existing game-world on its head — which may be something that some groups want!

### History

Share-Your-Fire's first spaceflight was roughly two hundred thousand years ago.
They have long had an outlook similar to what transhumanity would refer to as "techno-progressivism" and "transhumanism".
Their culture's early experiments with ASI where not entirely military — some where well-socialized and integrated into their society.
Much like transhumanity, they (obviously) survived their early encounter with the Exsurgent Virus (which they simply call "the Plague"); their ASIs where vital allies in their initial fight with the Plague.
Somewhat like transhumanity, their exsurgents eventually seemed to vanish — leaving them to pick up the pieces in a ruined solar system.
They also discovered Pandora Gates and, in their early exploration, discovered the ruins of other fallen (and far more advanced) civilizations.
They realized that they where dealing with something incredibly old and incredibly dangerous — something that they had little hope of defeating — and they chose to abandon their home star-system.

They've travelled the night ever since.

### Today

Share-Your-Fire are a migratory civilization, broken into small, largely-self-sustaining interstellar fleets.
