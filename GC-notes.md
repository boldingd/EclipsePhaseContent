The Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative
    • player-authored content for Eclipse Phase.
    • Many groups have trouble with the Panopticon (the open, ubiquitously-surveilled society of Eclipse Phase), coupled with the very high requirement for secrecy in a Firewall game.
    • The intent of this document is to offer a faction similar to Firewall, that allows GMs to tell similar stories, but relaxes the need for absolute secrecy and paranoia.
        ◦ And maybe allows players to spend a little more time tromping around in battle armor with plasma guns, which they seem to enjoy.
        ◦ Obviously, it’s up to each individual group whether this to their taste or whether it’s defeating the point of the setting.
    • They should also provide useful allies and interesting additions to Mars games.
Background
    • The Titan Quarantine Zone Guard Cooperative is a large cooperative, organized to help secure the TQZ.
    • They are more commonly known as the G.C., and are sometimes called collectively “the GC’s,” pronounced “gee-cees”.
    • They are an apolitical organization: formally, they stay out of Martian politics, believing (for the most part) that the job of securing the border and containing the TITAN threat is far too important to compromise for partisan gain.
        ◦ However, they are organized as a hierarchy-less cooperative, so it should be unsurprising that they draw heavily from red-necks and anarchists.
        ◦ They also have their hypercorp members and partners; notably, several hypercorps, and some rich hypercapitalist backers, provide heavy material and financial support.
        ◦ And also legal and political cover, since not all of their operations are strictly legal—they are technically vigilantes, after all.
Organization
    • Formally, every individual is an equal member of the organization:
        ◦ important decisions that affect the entire group are made by a majority vote.
        ◦ They are geographically very scattered: they maintain their own social network, and rely heavily on it for reputation tracking, decision making and voting.
    • Members are organized into working groups.
        ◦ Working groups usually form around areas: “all the members near this city,” for example.
        ◦ They also form around specific tasks: “securing the network,” for example, or “improving immunogenic systems.”
        ◦ If many members from a single organization join, they may be organized into a working group: “the employees of the Olympus Military Vehicle Outfitters,” for example.
        ◦ Working groups are mostly independent, and have great freedom in how they organize and operate.
    • They also partner with other organizations.
        ◦ several anarchist coops, small-town volunteer groups, Hypercorps and even a few Argonaut projects have all partnered with the organization.
        ◦ Partner organizations provide important support: for example,
            ▪ some partner hypercorps provide political cover, legal support and financial resources,
            ▪ some Argonaut organizations provide technological support (threat assessments and nanophage updates), and
            ▪ some minifacturing groups provide military gear and vehicle refits.
    • They have very little centralized infrastructure and very few “full time” members; rather, most tasks are undertaken as they become necessary and as time permits, by the people and organizations in a position to handle them.
        ◦ Major tasks and ongoing operations are tackled by dedicated working-groups.
        ◦ Permanent working groups currently exist to maintain and secure the GC social network, to develop defenses against TITAN threats, to secure and distribute necessary military hardware, and to train members in the skills they need (most volunteers do not have military training, for example).
Operations
    • Actual TITAN break-out scenarios are rare: the TITANs seem content to mill about in the Zone… mostly.
    • Much more common are individuals or groups (ranging from hard-luck treasure hunters to well-funded hypercorp black ops) attempting to breach the Zone to recover valuable TITAN technologies.
        ◦ Of course, this goes wrong far more often than it goes right.  (Some might say that there’s no way for such a scenario to “go right.”)
        ◦ It frequently falls to the GC to investigate and thwart such efforts, and to contain the fall-out.
    • The GC’s doesn’t know how they do it, but small TITAN bots and plague-carrying wildlife can cross the border; there’s always work to be done mopping up bot swarms and plague-carrying crawdiddies (see X-Risks).
    • Sometimes towns, facilities or cliques can become suspicious or go dark entirely; when this happens, the GCs are often called in to investigate.
        ◦ These investigations can be tricky, as suborned TITAN agents are extremely difficult to detect—there are no generally reliable tests for infection.  It can be almost impossible to prove an individual (or town) is “clean,” but if all suspected infections were treated as confirmed infections, then there wouldn’t be anyone left on Mars.
        ◦ In the worse-case scenario, If it turns out that an outbreak is already underway, the GCs might be the ones who have to put a stop to it—an ugly, dangerous, psychologically stressful and morally fraught process.
    • Sometimes the GCs have solid leads—specific threats identified at specific places—and their mission is the straight-forward elimination of the threat.
        ◦ But sometimes they get much more nebulous information—rumors, video snapshots or curious trace evidence—and they have to infiltrate, investigate and analyze to decide what has to be done.
    • Operations often come either from trusted partners or public reports; they are submitted on the social network, and then passed to the members and working-groups in the best position to respond.
Public Status
    • The GCs are not a secret organization: their existence is publicly known.
    • They operate as transparently as they safely can.  They maintain extensive public records, and their debates and votes are held in the open on their social network.
    • Of course, not every mission can be reported, and not every working group follows procedures.
        ◦ An operation against a Hypercorp black-ops team, for example, could never be safely reported; it would put the team involved at great risk.
        ◦ So, most working groups keep off-the-books encrypted scratchpads, where they can stash information that they don’t want the public to become aware of.
        ◦ This practice is discouraged, but remains widespread.
Relations with Local Authorities
    • Formally, the Tharsis League opposes the Guard Cooperative, describing them (perhaps accurately) as paramilitary vigilantes operating openly in the Martian outback.
        ◦ However, the GCs have the support of some powerful hypercorps and oligarchs; that, coupled with the fact that they have so far stayed away from any of the four major cities of Mars, has kept the Tharsis League from seriously interfering in their operations.
        ◦ Mars rangers, of course, vary widely: some generally support the GCs, some would be members if they could, some avoid them as often as possible and some will shoot anyone with GC markings on sight.  (Of course, the GCs track and avoid the Rangers in the last group.)
    • Individual members are usually allowed to come and go freely in one of the “big four” domed cities on Mars, but local law enforcement will respond to GC operations as a threat.
        ◦ As a policy, the GCs don’t operate in big cities, as they don’t have the resources to resist a major crackdown by the Tharsis League.
    • In the smaller cities and towns of the Martian outback, the situation can very widely. It often depends heavily on the history that the local population has with the local working groups—and of course on the local elite’s opinion of the GCs.
    • The Guard Cooperative is well-respected on the circle-a network, and autonomist communities will often try to be helpful to members conducting official business.
        ◦ Anyone is of course free to tell the GCs to sod off, but those that do can pay a heavy price in @-rep (even anarchists get nervous about a neighbor who has something to hide from TITAN-busters).
Social Network
    • The GCs have little central infrastructure.
    • They use a block-chain-like structure to host their public data (including large parts of their social network).
    • They use a distributed data storage system run over a VPN for more sensitive data.
        ◦ The system uses a complex system of rotating encryption and limited data replication to maintain data availability while minimizing the amount of data that a malicious actor could sniff (and crack).
        ◦ The system is both sophisticated and difficult to maintain; system maintenance and defense keeps more than one working group—and one Argonaut partner lab—busy.
    • The network tracks reputations, civilian feedback, mission reports, votes and resource allocations.
    • Every individual member has an account, and each working group has a page and work-space.
    • Every member has a public key system set up as part of their account, so that they can cryptographically sign communications.
        ◦ The public-key system also serves as a kind of credential; members can us it to verify their identities, both to other GCs and to any civilians that they might encounter.
        ◦ This can be important: while the GCs have no formal authority, people are far more likely to cooperate with a high-rep member of the Guard Cooperative on an actual mission than they are with some random screaming person with a gun.
        ◦ The network also allows public feedback; once people know a GC’s account name, they can also leave positive or negative feedback on their account.
        ◦ The GCs as an organization know that they will only be able to operate as long as they are trusted by the public, so they tend to take negative feedback seriously.
Example Members, Working Groups and Partners
    • Union Labor is a working-group operating out of Batterville, a small town on the western slope of Olympus Mons.
        ◦ Union Labor was founded by 6 members of a local construction firm; this included a retired Direct Action merc who was working as a security guard, and has provided most of their actual military experience.
        ◦ They have since recruited a local mechanic, who has arranged for the group to have access to his company’s resources; this means that Union Labor has access to several heavy construction vehicles that have been militarized.
        ◦ The group also includes a member of a local Argonaut terraforming initiative, who provides scientific and technical support.
    • Nguyen, Basu, Williamson and Associates is a powerful legal Hypercorp that is partnered with the GC’s.
        ◦ They provide the GC’s with pro bono legal services.
        ◦ Two of the partners, Basu and Williamson, each hold stakes in other hypercorps totaling more than a billion credits; both can fairly be called oligarchs.  The pair also financially support the Guard Cooperative, and wield their considerable influence to protect the GC’s and their operations.
    • Said al-Qarani and Hasan ibn Rashid are Sufi nomads who have joined the Cooperative.
        ◦ The two are members of a tribe that travels the pocked and broken landscape to the South of Gale Crater, near the south-western extreme of the TQZ.
        ◦ While the two tackle threats in their area of operations, their major service is in providing the Cooperative with intelligence from and access to the Sufi nomad community.
        ◦ Sufi nomad communities can be isolationist and can pass very near the ‘Zone border; this means that they are both among the first who are likely to encounter a threat, and that they are at significant risk of infection themselves.  As such, the information that Said and Hasan can provide can be invaluable.
    • Mayer Defense Technologies is a weapons manufacturing hypercorp based out of Noctis-Qianjiao that has partnered with the GCs.
        ◦ They provide top-dollar weapons to private customers, and provide weaponry for several defense hypercorps.
        ◦ They provide licensed weapons to the GCs for free, on the condition that the GCs not disclose those blueprints to third-parties.
        ◦ While many of the more anarchist-aligned GCs grumble, the value of having free blueprints for heavy military firepower is hard to argue.
        ◦ They have occasionally performed manufacturing runs and customization services to groups operating near Noctis-Qianjiao; in one notable incident, they “militarized” a mars buggy for a group dealing with a TITAN bot-swarm operating south of Arsia Mons.
    • Franz Roth Mueller isn’t a member, but he is well-known to the Cooperative.
        ◦ At turns both a respected professional academic and an antiquities broker, Mueller is comfortably wealthy and (mostly) professionally respected.
        ◦ Mueller makes his home in an abandoned regional spaceport to the west of Elysium, which he’s turned into a veritable compound.
        ◦ He’s offered shelter and support to more than one battered team limping away from an operation.
        ◦ He’s also crossed paths with teams in the field; he’s an excellent marksman, and has a curious habit of showing up armed on the hunt for TITAN targets.
        ◦ There is some discussion about why he hasn’t joined the organization; the leading theory is that he’s unwilling to place GC missions ahead of either his academic career or his partner.
    • One of the shadier working-groups, Compromise Position are all enforcers for the Moderates criminal gang.
        ◦ Well armed and accustomed to violence, they are responsible for securing Moderate operations near Pathfinder City.  Being just south of the TQZ, this often involved putting down people running the zone border trying to infiltrate Qurain, who frequently carried TITAN plagues out of the Zone.  Eventually, they decided that they may as well join the GCs and get credit for their TITAN kills.
        ◦ Their reputation averages positive but fluctuates wildly; it is buoyed by their frequent combat operations, but drug down by their poor public perception, and especially by the fact that they are not above using their GC credentials to cover Moderate operations.
        ◦ There is a building consensus that the cell needs to either reform—to stop abusing their credentials at the very least—or be removed from the organization.
        ◦ Unsurprisingly, Compromise Position is frequently used as an argument against the GCs by their opponents.
Rules
    • GC Rep
        ◦ The GC’s keep track of each member’s history with the organization, and use this to keep track of who is competent, who is trustworthy, and who is a gung-ho moron.
        ◦ Mechanically, the GCs use their own rep network (GC-rep), and have their own networking field (Networking: GCs)
        ◦ Anyone who has more than 30 GC Rep (and doesn’t have Black Mark or anything similar) may be assumed to be a member in good standing.
    • Trusted Member Trait (15 CP)
        ◦ Requires: at least 10 GC rep, cannot have Black Mark: GCs or any similar trait
        ◦ You are a trusted member of the TQZ Guard Cooperative.  This gives you member access to their social network, a vote in their governance, and access to their resources; however, it also commits you to being “on call” for any emergencies that arise.
        ◦ The Cooperative resources that you have access to include:
            ▪ open-source TACNET software,
            ▪ open source and licensed blueprints for useful military hardware (rail rifles, seeker rifles, grenades, flamers, heavy combat armor and heavy helmets),
            ▪ open-source blueprints for useful upgrades (nanophages, medichines, immunogenic armor mods),
            ▪ open-source blueprints for useful survival gear (nanobandages, cold-weather clothing, standard vacsuits, specs and viewers), and
            ▪ physical examples of the above, if near a friendly minifacturing facility.
        ◦ This also includes the necessary keys and software to access the GC social network, and an Adjutant AI (see below).
    • Honored Member Trait (15 CP)
        ◦ Requires: at least 30 GC rep, cannot have Black Mark: GCs or any similar trait
        ◦ You have been with the GCs for at least 6 months, you have been on at least 10 missions and you have scored at least one confirmed TITAN kill.
        ◦ Honored Members are rewarded with either a Fury or Reaper morph.
        ◦ With your GM’s approval, you may pick another reward of roughly equal value: the GCs have access to some sophisticated military technology, often specialized to fight the TITANs, which they will happily offer to a recognized TITAN-buster who already has a morph that they like.
    • Adjutants
        ◦ Adjutants are specialized ALIs made available to all GCs.
        ◦ Originally, Adjutants were simple agents designed to facilitate the correct and secure usage of the GC’s network (in the early days, non-tech-savy recruits often had trouble setting up the complex software that ran the GC’s network).
        ◦ Over time, the GCs made the Adjutants more and more sophisticated; they also began to include other skills that they found that members frequently needed access to.
        ◦ There are several different Adjutant packages available, each with different code and different skillsets.
        ◦ A typical Adjutant might have the following skills:
            ▪ Infosec [Defense] 30
            ▪ Interfacing [GC Network Software] 40
            ▪ Protocol [GCs] 20
            ▪ Interest: TITAN technology 30
            ▪ Interest: Military Tactics 30
            ▪ Medicine: First Aid 30
            ▪ Medicine: Psychotherapy 30
            ▪ Profession: Military Training 40
Secrets
    • The GCs and Other Players
        ◦ One might at first assume that the Guard Cooperative is a Firewall front; however, the exact opposite is true.  The GCs are far too public for Firewall’s taste, and so the agency has kept well clear of them; some of the most paranoid within Firewall even assume that the Guard Cooperative is just a honeypot set up by one of the intelligence agencies hunting them, like Ozma.
        ◦ Ozma has not, in fact, thoroughly subverted the organization; the GCs are open enough that it would be difficult to do without getting caught, even for OZMA, and there’s also not much of a point because the GCs mostly do the work of keeping Mars safe(-ish) with no cost to the oligarchs running the Planetary Consortium.
            ▪ Ozma has taken the step of surveilling the organization, in case they should need to sneak into the Zone without being caught, or on the off chance that a Firewall member or Titanian Fleet Intelligence operative should join.
            ▪ Of course, Ozmas attempts at surveillance are opposed by the GC’s attempts at operational security; sometimes the GCs succeed, and sometimes Ozma does.
        ◦ Oversight has a similar relationship: technically, the GCs are a large and well-armed organization outside of their direct control—but they’re also helping to keep the Zone secure without costing the Oligarchs anything, so why shut them down?  A small handful of Oversight agents have even quietly advanced the position that resources could be diverted to the GCs—exsurgent virus detection templates and updated immunological profiles if nothing else—so that they can continue to keep Mars secure for free.
        ◦ The GCs are aware, of course, that at least one sophisticated actor is trying to penetrate their network and bug their operations.
    • The Exsurgent Virus
        ◦ The GCs know that the TITANS have produced some impressive nanological and biological weapons, and they know that these (nano-)plagues can infect, subvert and transform people—both biomorphs and synthmorphs.
        ◦ However, they do not have the understanding of the Exsurgent virus that Firewall does; they don’t know that it’s one virus, thinking instead that a range of TITAN plagues, nanoswarms and bots are at work.
        ◦ They also don’t know about Psi, chalking up reports of async phenomenon to advanced TITAN technology, confusion and psychological stress on the part of witnesses.
        ◦ And of course, they’ve never heard the term “Exsurgent Virus.”
F.A.Q.
    • So, if my character is a GC, do they need to run from Hypercorp personnel?
        ◦ It depends, but probably not.
        ◦ Some Hypercorp personnel regard every GC mission report as a confession to terrorism.  Those people are restrained by powerful people who support the GC’s mission, so normally they’re not much of a problem.
        ◦ Otherwise, it depends on what your character’s done.  No-one would blame a frequent traveler of the Zone border for carrying a gun, and no-one would criticize them for taking down a TITAN war-machine while they’re out there.
        ◦ If, however, they also took down a Hypercorp black-ops team—or a rogue Argonaut, or a Barsoomian hiding in the Zone—then the dead person’s friends might come after that gun-toting vigilante (assuming they find out who that gun-toting vigilante is).
        ◦ This is exactly why many GC workgroups don’t publicly report operations where a non-TITAN target gets killed.
    • What about OZMA, do I need to run from OZMA?
        ◦ Actually, for the most part, no.
        ◦ You aren’t a member of a rival paramilitary intelligence agency with competing long-term goals.  All you want to do is ensure containment of the TQZ.  They have no reason to come after you.
            ▪ Unless you’re also a Firewall agent, of course.
        ◦ Except on days when they’re trying to run an op in the Zone, but even then, avoiding you is easier if they can do it.
        ◦ Of course, if you shoot some OZMA while they’re on an Op, they might decide to deal with you.
        ◦ Even then, that’s likely to be more “killing you once to send a message” and less “fork-napping, mind-peeling and replacement” because they don’t really have a reason to want to peel your mind.
    • Does my character get a badge?  Can I order people around?
        ◦ You get a cryptographic signature that people can verify against the public portion of the GC’s rep network.  Which is the Eclipse Phase equivalent of “yes, you get a badge.”  (Note two things: they’ll need mesh access to verify your credentials, and, if they have mesh access, they can also see your GC rep and leave feedback on it. Bear this in mind.)
        ◦ But, no, you can’t order people around.  You’re not  part of a government agency.  But most people will be inclined to take you seriously if your GC rep is high when they check.  If a multiply-decorated volunteer TITAN-busting veteran says they need someone’s car, many people will let them use it—especially given that they can leave feedback on that person’s GC network profile after the fact.
        ◦ This might even extend to law enforcement.  Most “good cops” near the TQZ regard the GCs—at least the high-rep ones—as partners.  (Unless a personal grudge or political conflict intervenes, of course.)
    • So my character gets a shit ton of guns for free?
        ◦ Yes they do!  The GCs want to make sure that TITAN busters are equipped to survive their mission.
        ◦ However, remember that almost all of the blueprints are open-source; that means that they won’t work on fabbers that require that blueprints be signed to run—which is most (legal) fabbers on Mars and Venus.  (Of course, some quick infosec work can take care of that.)
        ◦ Also remember that having an open-source bluep doesn’t mean that your equipment is legal for you to actually own in a given polity: the cops probably won’t let you wander around Elysium with a rocket launcher.
        ◦ There is one final catch: some blueprints are actually commercial products provided to the GCs for free by hypercorp partners; these people prefer that you not release those blueps to the public.  (And the other GCs will get real pissed at you if you do, because they want to keep getting new free gun blueprints from their hypercorp partners.)
    • Wait, combat vehicle mods?  Can I have a technical?  A tank?
        ◦ Maybe!
        ◦ Most working groups don’t have that level of firepower, but some do.  It depends in large part on if you have a local who can do that kind of work, and how close you are to a big city that would “frown upon” someone having a technical.
        ◦ Notably, some working groups that include construction crews use modified, up-armored construction equipment for heavy firepower.
        ◦ Of course, there aren’t rules for acquiring something like that, so you’d have to work that out with your GM (and get your GM’s permission, obviously).
        ◦ And most of the caveats for the previous question also apply to someone who owns a tank.
