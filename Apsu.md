Apsu is a primordial exoworld currently being contested by groups backed by the Planetary Consortium, the Autonomist Alliance, and a handful of others.
It's appealing because it should be very easy to terraform – easier than Mars, even accounting for the 60-year head start.
But it's also a challenge because it has *at least* two gates, and probably more, with paths from both the Pathfinder and Discord gates.
Rather than rush heavy infrastructure and armed forces to the world, the solar system's great power blocks are contesting it the old-fashioned way: a good old proxy war.
Each bloc is throwing their malcontents and losers through, and providing them with just enough resources, support, and weaponry to keep the planet in play.

So far, Apsu's threat profile is minimal; most settlements are still focusing on establishing themselves, and there's no sign of local life or prior habitation – other than the gate itself, of course, which raises questions.
But Proxies generally don't like to be blindsided; hence, this writeup.

## History

The history is a little hazy, since a lot of this information has to be carried through the gates on foot, and we have only the word of the 'crashers involved to go on.
It looks like the world was first discovered by 'crashers from the Mars (Pathfinder) gate, in AF 10.2; no fools they, they immediately recognized what they had, reported the address to their sponsors back in Sol, and walked away with a nice hit of cash and rep.
And thus was a claim on "E-W Ochre" entered in Pathfinder's records.

Little did they know there was another gate on the world.
'Crashers from the Oberon gate (the Fissure gate, operated by our dear friends in Love and Rage) discovered the world in AF 10.31.
The gate they used – now called the Reed Gate, to fit with the loose mesopotamian theme – was located eleven thousand kilometers from the gate the hypercapitalist team used (now somewhat begrudgingly dubbed the Ishtar Gate).
At the time, they did not (and could not have) detected the claim beacon left by the previous team; so they planted their own.
It was not until AF 10.64, after news of these claims had been carried on foot back through their respective gates and claims-table-updates had been radioed around the Sol system, that anyone even pointed out that these two claims *might* be on the same world.
And it wasn't until AF 10.81 that a radio message from New Glory colony (a hypercapitalist settlement) was detected at Descartes (an autonomist settlement backed by Lociis).

You will not be surprised to hear that the autonomists do not consider the hypercapitalist claim to be legitimate – they sure as hell are not willing to let filthy capitalists claim an *entire planet*, even if it turns out they really did get there first.
Officials in the Gatekeeper and the Consortium, for their part, do not consider the autonomist presence on Apsu to be legitimate, and have continued to protest it in every forum they have access to.
They can repeat "carthago delende est" as much as they want; at present, with the Oberon gate located all the way out at Neptune and the Reed Gate being 9 megameters from the Ishtar Gate, there's fuck all they can do about it.

Complicating matters is that the Ultimates have somehow showed up on Apsu.
Nobody particularly wants them there, and nobody has admitted to letting them through.
And their encampment is out in the middle of nowhere.
Some people point fingers *of course*, but the most likely explanation – and the one that most people assume – is that there's third gate located somewhere on Apsu, and that there's a path to it from the Discord Gate (the one out at Eris, in the Kuiper belt, operated by Go-Nin but defended by the Ultimates – I'll leave it to the comments to decide who "owns" it).

Even more recently, just to drive the point home, in AF 11.17, a connection was made from the Pandora Gate (the one on the Saturnian moon Pandora, operated by Gatekeeper) to Coleman.
While you'll still need hypercapitalist permission to get from Coleman to Apsu, most people have, by this point, accepted that the fight over Apsu is going to be long, and it will not be settled in the courts.

## Apsu

Apsu is a primordial world.
The world has no biosphere at present; the surface is bare rock, and the atmosphere has about 4.5% CO2 – toxic to unmodified terrestrial life.

The distinction between "primordial" and "dead" is important: Apsu has potential.
Apsu has a strong magnetosphere; if you don't run in exo-exploratory circles, that is incredibly important.
Not only does it mean that the level of cosmic radiation on Apsu's surface is survivable to unmodified terrestrial life – no need to bury settlements or construct fuck-off huge orbiting megastructures that will be single points of failure for an *entire planet*! – but it also means that Apsu has been able to retain the lighter elements of its atmosphere against solar winds.
Apsu's atmosphere is broadly similar to Earth's atmosphere – back when Earth was alive, at least.
(My apologies everyone.)
Apsu's atmosphere is about 76% nitrogen, 19% oxygen, 4.5% CO2, and about half a percent water.

That composition is a gift.
That might not sound like much CO2, but that's far, far more than you'd need to establish an Earth-like/Garden World biosphere.
And while it heats Apsu up a fair bit, it's bearable; equatorial temperatures hit 85C, but middle-lattitudes hover between 30C and 40C, depending on season; polar winter night will get down to a cool 5C!

Depending on how big you want your oceans to be, we *might* not even need cometary bombardment.
Apsu already has some surface oceans; as the terraforming process cools the planet, some of the atmospheric water will condense out.

An unmodified human can already walk around parts of Apsu – you'll need a filter for the CO2, and it'll be hot and muggy, but you can do it.
And all the ingredients for a garden world are there; we just need to pull the CO2 out of the atmosphere and turn it into a biosphere.
And we had a decent idea for how to do that 60+ years ago.

## Other Worlds

They've already come up a few times, so it's worth talking about them directly before we go further: Apsu is not the only world involved.

First off, Apsu is not reachable *directly* from Sol.
To get to the Ishtar Gate, you first go from the Mars gate to Coleman – named after the first member to die in the 'crasher crew that discovered it – and then go from Coleman to the Ishtar Gate on Apsu.
Meanwhile, to get to the Reed Gate, you have to go from Oberon to Ur Nova, and then from Ur Nova to the Reed Gate.
Both factions have, of course, heavily fortified those gates.

Coleman is a cold ball of rock, a bit like Mars.
Roughly earth-sized, but with a weaker magnetosphere and thinner atmosphere.
It's also further from it's primary, making it fairly cold.
(Coleman itself might be *slightly* better candidate for terraforming than Mars, if we didn't have a head-start on Mars and if Apsu wasn't right next door.)

Ur Nova, meanwhile, is on a dwarf planet, like Ceres.
It has no atmosphere and no magnetosphere; not a great place to try to terraform, but a great place for an outpost.
Ur Nova has rich deposits of ice, organics, and metals; the low gravity makes construction relatively easy; and, conveniently, the Ur Gate is located in an asteroid crater, conveniently close to a small ravine – the perfect place for an outpost.

Apsu isn't even the only colonized world in its system.
In AF 7.6, an Extropian cooperative purchased the rights to Blueblood Paradise, an organic-rich but freezing cold moon orbiting an ice giant.
A bit like Titan, but more hospitable, as these things go.

Also, yes, I know.
Apparently, the team that found it weren't particularly creative and had trouble naming the thing.
Somebody eventually said "fuck it, we'll just call it 'silt ball'", somebody else said that "sounded like a paradise for horseshoe crabs," and the team decided that was as good a name as any – and hell, making some gate operator type that might be funny.
In their defense, they did not expect anyone to be in a rush to colonize "silt-ball".

They failed to account for belters.
An Extropians co-op saw a fixer-upper they could snatch for a bargain, bought the claim to the place, bought time on the Pandora gate, and proceeded colonize 'Paradise itself – they liked how stupid the name was, natch – and were starting to explore some of the other moons when they received a weak signal from a rocky planet in the inner system.
Turns out, Blueblood Paradise and Apsu are in the same system.

It's probably going to be *decades* before anyone in the Apsu/Silt Ball system builds a ship, so we won't need to worry much about horseshoe crab utopia for the time being.
Well, other than this: three gates have already been publicly confirmed in the system, with a fourth *very* likely.
The surprise is starting to wear off; at this point, most people are bracing for more.

## Colonization

So, Apsu is a primordial world.
Too much potential to ignore, too long-term to fight for – both the Consortium and Titanians have colonized worlds that already have biospheres *now*, and TerraGenesis has a dozen extrasolar projects in the works.
And, of course, bad neighbors: capitalists, anarchists, and fascists all have their plot staked out already.
