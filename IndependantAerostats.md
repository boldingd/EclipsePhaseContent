# Independant Aerostats

> In some of my games, I've added a "long tail" of small, independent aerostats.
> I think this works for two reasons: one is that it makes sense, because if producing zeppelins is easy, then it should also be relatively easy to produce small habitats; the other is that it makes Venus more interesting, because it creates an independent social structure, somewhat like the small towns and souks of Mars – which can make politics more interesting, add variety, and provide a space for criminals, outsiders, and Firewall agents to operate.

The large aerostats of the Morningstar Constellation share the skies of Venus with a number of smaller aerostats.
Some of these are minor members of the Constellation; others are members of other factions, with only a minor presence on Venus; and still others are entirely independent.
Some even have no known identity or affiliation.

*Calypso* is a minor member of the Morningstar Constellation, closely associated with Octavia.
Calypso's economy is heavily focused on tourism, containing a number of resorts, luxury hotels, a wide selection of restaurants, and large observation decks.
Their particular specialty is storm-chasing; the aerostat often steers courses to large storms and cloud formations, getting significantly closer than many larger aerostats would risk.

They are dependant on other aerostats – especially Octavia – for most other services.
In particular, they rarely connect to surface tethers, are not equipped to receive OTVs; almost everything that comes from the surface or from space must first be delivered to Octavia, and then shipped to Calypso by conventional means.
