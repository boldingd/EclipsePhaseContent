The large aerostats of the Morningstar Constellation share the skies of Venus with a number of smaller aerostats.
Some of these are minor members of the Constellation; others are members of other factions, with only a minor presence on Venus; and still others are entirely independent.
Some even have no known identity or affiliation.

## Botany

| Botany | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 8K |
| Languages | English, Afrikaans, Vietnamese, Arabic |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Independent, Criminal |
| Economy | Mixed |

Botany is a (mostly) gang-held aerostat that operates far from any major aerostat or likely flight path; it provides a haven for Venus's criminal element.

Botany was initially constructed in BF 17 as an attempt by a conglomerate of South African and Australian mining corporations, the South-Pacific Corporation for the Development of Venus.
The aerostat they built was sturdily-constructed, and intended mainly for industrial use; this required it to be relatively large, so that it could enclose enough lifting volume to carry the heavy frame and industrial equipment.
At the same time, it was lightly populated, housing a crew of only 190 people.

Within a decade, rapid improvements in nanofabrication rendered much of the existing industrial equipment obsolete; at the same time, increases in the number of people accepting indentures to get off Earth led to the original workforce slowly being replaced by people who were effectively slaves.
Discharged workers often had nowhere else to go; attempts to evict them were practical death sentences, which often led to violent resistance.
Riots began to break out in the later months of BF 12; organized strikes and disorganized riots continued for the next several years, culminating in BF 8 when the aerostat's overseers were overthrown and the SPCDV's loyalists and enforcers were thrown overboard.
The hastily-organized union then entered into direct negotiations with the SPCDV.
Rather than meet their demands, the SPCDV shifted their focus to newer aerostats – aerostats which did not need extensive refits or updates, and that did not have embedded local populations that the corporation did not control.
This left Botany without a revenue stream.

Eventually, an operating agreement was struck with the SPCDV, which allowed the aerostat to limp along; under the agreement, in exchange for a pittance in payment and access to the SPCDV's internal markets, the aerostat stored surplussed equipment, provided manufacturing support for other operations, and served as a punishment detail for problem employees.
Botany had been frozen out of most of the early hypercapitalist markets, leading to chronic shortages.
Early nanofabrication had at least made it to the aerostat, which the habitat's residents used to break down several large pieces of industrial machinery, and to retrofit the aerostat to support its larger population.
The union had substantially failed to improve local conditions and had lost public support; crime rose substantially.

When the Fall came, the SPCDV was wiped out, abruptly turning Botany into an independent aerostat.
By that time, a balance of power had emerged between the largest gangs on the habitat, the remnants of the original unions, and a nascent punk-anarchist movement.
After the Fall, the arrangement was formalized: in AF 3, the Botany Truce was struck between the habitat's four largest gangs, the remnants of the Botany Union, and the "Live from the Skies over Hell" cooperative, the largest punk-anarchist community on the hab.

In the years since the Fall, the various groups and communities on Botany have connected with external allies – the gangs making connection with other criminals on Venus, and the Botany Union and Scum reaching out to contacts in the Autonomist  Alliance.
More modern nanofabrication finally came to Botany through these channels, leading to substantial updates to much of the habitat's infrastructure and making local life much less desperate.

Botany has become something of a nexus for criminals and outsiders on Venus.
It hosts a substantial number of hackers, and the local digital piracy scene flourishes.
The Scum offer any number of hedonistic pursuits, mediated only by consent; criminal gangs offer darker services – a notable example being the SP Crew, an especially brutal gang that specializes in strike-breaking.
The Botany Union protects the aerostat's few legitimate businesses, while also handling the thankless task of keeping the habitat from plummeting from the sky.

While soul-traders have been substantially kept away from Botany, the habitat also hosts Ereshkigal, a black-market psychosurgeon notable for her willingness to do anything to any ego, subject only to payment.
She is also notable for her entourage, which is also a demonstration of power: she is escorted by eight people whose egos she accessed and conditioned for complete obedience.

## Bremerhaven

| Bremerhaven | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 19K |
| Languages | English, German |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Skyfarer's League |
| Economy | Transitional |

Bremerhaven is minor aerostat whose primary industry is ship-building.
It provides the Skyfarer's League – as well as other independent aerostats – with the ability to design and construct new airships.

Physically, Bremerhaven is a wide construction; four long, skeletal arms extend from a central, lense-like main body.
The themselves are more than 350m long, while the central body is 255m in diameter and 55m high.
The arms are studded with docks and construction yards; these facilities, together with the arcing lines of the habitat, give it an almost gothic look.
Each arm ends in its own smaller, lens-like enclosure, each 113m in diameter and 36m high.
The top halves of the enclosures are given over to public pavilions; below that, there is a maze of small office spaces and corporate facilities.

Several detached dockyards also float nearby, owned and operated by a variety of concerns.
These dockyards vary in scale and capability: many of them are smaller facilities, housing only a few constructions bays, but a few are much larger, owned by conglomerates of local industries and housing several yards and their supporting equipment.

The habitat hosts a number of hypercorps dedicated to aerospace design and construction.
Notably, the habitat is the primary point of construction for the *Osprey*, a small drone fighter used by the League for defense.
It is also involved in a collaborative project with Miquelon, designing self-growing and self-modifying airships; though this is a long-term project, if successful, it could radically alter the political landscape of Venus.

## Brunswick

| Brunswick | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 26K |
| Languages | English, Spanish, Greek |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Skyfarer's League |
| Economy | Transitional |

Brunswick, named after a town in the pre-Fall southeastern United States, is a member of the Skyfarer's League.
The habitat is an open market; though small, its economy is vibrant, and it has ties to Extropian (and, in particular, Mutualist) enclaves in the main belt.
It is a vital driver of the League's economy.

Brunswick uses a left-libertarian civil scheme.
The habitat is owned directly by its residents, and administered via direct democracy.
It has a minimal state apparatus, which performs a limited set of functions:

- they administer the habitat's major infrastructure and maintain its public systems;
- they run a minimal police and judicial system, whose primary role is to oversee the network of private dispute-resolution organizations;
- they maintain the habitat's civil-defense force;
- and they oversee the habitat's minimum-income scheme.

For everything else, residents rely on private contracts within the habitat's markets.

Brunswick's minimalist, market-oriented system interfaces well with Extropian habitats in the main 'belt, and it has particularly close ties with a number of Mutualist habitats and enclaves.
One byproduct of the ties is that the habitat is tied into an Extropian egocasting and communications network; this gives residents of Brunswick quick and easy access to several larger habitats and economies, and allows for the easy movement of culture, blueprints, and people.
Besides Brunswick's own local economy, this easy access to the Extropian 'belt is a major benefit that the habitat provides to the League.

These connections are also a source of tension, however.
It is an open secret that Brunswick has received egocasts from the Extropian belt that did not meet the requirements of the League's identity system.
So far, the League has been willing to suffer a handful of an-caps and mutualists wandering about without valid identities.

## Calypso

| Calypso | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | Variable; 5K permanent, up to 7K visitors |
| Languages | English, Spanish, Greek |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Morningstar Constellation |
| Economy | Transitional |

Calypso is a minor member of the Morningstar Constellation, closely associated with Octavia.

It began life during the Fall, when it was constructed to receive refugees.
After the Fall, the habitat became a possession of Octavia, in a deal that gave Calypso access to money and resources for development it would not otherwise have had.
It was refitted and upgraded in AF 3; after it relaunched, it began to host a number of luxury tourism hypercorps.
Calypso was carried into the Morningstar Constellation with Octavia in AF 6; the following year, Calypso voted to separate from Octavia, becoming an independent member of the Constellation.
It has since maintained strong ties with Octavia – it has been called a "suburb" of the larger hab.

The moniker describes a cultural connection to Octavia, but not a physical one.
The habitat is a storm-chaser; it is willing to approach large cloud formations much more closely than most other aerostats – sometimes ranging quite far afield to do so.
While this can provide particularly breathtaking vistas, it also means that the habitat is exposed to risks that other aerostats would avoid.
Sometimes, it even passes through sulfuric-acid storm-clouds themselves; this offers guests a unique experience, but also exposes the habitat and its mechanisms to significant wear.
For this reason, the habitat is more heavily-reinforced than other small aerostats usually are, and its systems are particularly designed for resistance to sulfuric acid; it also has particularly large and powerful electrofan motors.

Physically, the habitat has something of a "double teardrop" shape, with the large, spherical upper module smoothly tapering to a slender "neck," then expanding to a smaller lower module.
The upper module is larger, roughly 350m in diameter, and contains living spaces, open parks and promenades, and resort facilities.
The lower module is smaller, about 125m in diameter, and contains the habitats material reserves, bulk storage, support systems, and their few industrial centers and minifacturies.
The smaller module is of course much denser than the upper one, and serves to counter-weight it, keeping the habitat upright.
The whole habitat is roughly 700m high.

The hull of the habitat is made of aluminum-oxide, doped for both corrosion resistance and color.
The whole outer hull is transparent; much of it is a translucent ochre, allowing Venus's dim natural light to filter in while affording residents and visitors a measure of privacy, but the observation blisters are a transparent and neutral, providing an excellent view of the skies and storm-clouds of Venus.

The upper module contains eight large terraces, in a "1-3-3-1" layout – one on bottom, forming a torus around the central support pylon that feeds into the connecting neck; three below the "equator" of the habitat, with large, transparent blisters looking downward; three above the "equator", with large blisters looking upward; and one on top, with a blister looking towards the sky.
While the layouts of the terraces are different, most are laid out like deformed cylinders, and most are roughly 150m in diameter, and roughly 40m high at the center.
They support various environments: one of the lower terraces is laid out like a park, with paved sidwalks and grass lawns in a broad arc around the downward-facing observation blister; meanwhile, one of the upper terraces is dominated by a small patch of deciduous forrest, complete with pines, oaks, and a small population of squirrels, hares, and owls, all ringed with an elevated faux-timber promenade.
(The squirrels are hated by residents nearly as much as they are loved by visitors; even more controversial is a small population of smart raccoons, which have proven to be particularly adept at both charming visitors and escaping the environment.)
Notably, each of the large terraces is designed to be sealed in emergencies, as is the central column within the upper sphere module.

It's something of an open secret that the habitat has a secondary industry.
Calypso has relatively robust privacy laws, sometimes ranges far from other aerostats – sometimes even wandering out of mesh contact, and has a relatively "flexible" approach to many of the Constellation's financial reporting laws; for all of these reasons, it also serves as something of hypercorporate tax haven.

## Landis

| Landis | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 255 |
| Languages | Variable |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Argonauts |
| Economy | None / Institutional |

Landis is a small argonaut-controlled aerostat.
It is not a research outposts; instead, it serves as a secure facility for hosting meetings and archives.
Facilities include physical meeting spaces; archives both secure and public; communications equipment; a farcaster and body-bank; and servers and small quarters for housing visitors both physical and virtual.

Physically, Landis consists of a cylindrical oxygen/nitrogen enclosure 90m high and 100m in radius, with a small reserve of water and feed-stock hanging beneath to serve as a counter-weight.

## Moriah

| Moriah | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 23 |
| Languages | Russian, English |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Independent |
| Economy | None |

Moriah is a Eclectic-Abrahamic monastery.

Eclectic Abrahamism is a conservative religious movement whose origins reach back more than a hundred years before the Fall.
The Eclectic-Abrahamic movement loosely united a number of conservative religious movements and figures active in the early years of space colonization, allowing them to accrue much more social and political power than they otherwise would have.
The movement was explicitly conservative and authoritarian; it made Abraham its central figure, viewing him as an icon of both faith and patriarchal authority.
Unsurprisingly, the were (and are) extremely critical of the technological advances that were occurring at the time, and the social changes that they enabled; today, they are, of course, highly bio-conservative.

Moriah – named for the mountain where Abraham went to sacrifice Isaac – hosts a number of ascetics hailing primarily from Non-Denominational Evangelical and Independent Orthodox backgrounds.

Physically, the monastery is a roughly-cylindrical construction, 30m high and 40m in diameter.
Large alcoves are positioned around the exterior, which host holographic projections of religious scenes and icons rendered in a range of styles.
Wide faux-stained-glass windows provide illumination.

Although the habitat does not formally forbid visitors, it has no known connections to other habitats and communities outside the Eclectic-Abrahamic movement.
Given their views of transhuman culture and the vast majority of living transhumans, it receives little traffic.
It is not known how the habitat funds its operations; presumably, they are supported by some wealthy patron friendly to the movement.

> **Padre**: These people are not well respected among those of us who take the Christian mission seriously.
> They didn't like being told to love or forgive people they thought of as freaks, so they created their own 'pure'  scriptures without any of that 'pussy' compassion or forgiveness.
> And then they threw the door open to anyone who was generally monotheistic and hated women, gays, weakness, and just human compassion generally.
> ... I'm sorry, I have strong feelings about this.
>
> **anarcat**: No, no, have at.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: I was going to ask, on a scale of 1 to C-BEAT, what are we talking about here?
> It sounds like an 11.
>
> **Padre**: Past 11.
> If you've ever resleeved, you aren't a person.
> If you're an uplift or AGI, you're not a person.
> If you weren't conceived and born naturally, you're not a person.
> If you're not straight, you're corrupted.
> If you don't meet their definition of "man", then you're subservient to the "men".
> And, depending on why you don't meet it, also corrupted.
> Proxy identity risk, but they would treat me as a heretic, because my church gives communion to people they do not consider people.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: So, probably not a great place to visit.

>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Probably?

## Lazy Susan

| Lazy Susan | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Spaceship; Module hab, with two toruses |
| Gravity | 0.5G and 0.25G |
| Population | 30K |
| Languages | Mandarin, Hindi, German, French |
| Location | Mobile |
| Faction | Morningstar Constellation |
| Economy | Transitional, Mixed |

The Lazy Susan is an unusual, large construction that blurs the line between spacecraft and habitat.
The 'Susan consists of two large centrigrav habitats, connected by a central structure, and propelled by a large fusion motor.

The Lazy Susan was created when two torus habitats voted to leave the LLA and join the Morningstar Constellation.
They lined the habitats up, connected them with a superstructure running through their central hubs, mounted a fusion motor on one end, and departed the Earth-Luna L1 point for Venus.
When they arrived they joined the Morningstar Constellation, but they did not dismantle the superstructure and "settle" in Venusian orbit; instead, they remain a large spacecraft – boasting two large toruses and a population of 5 thousand people – traveling routes within the inner system.

Physically, the Lazy Susan consists of two older toruses, connected by a central spire or structure.
The front torus was of Chinese construction, built in BF 46, roughly 550m in radius and spun to 0.5g; the rear torus was of Indian construction, built in BF 42, roughly 475m in radius, and spun to 0.25g.
The central spine is 1,175m long; it consists of a sturdy open framework, strung with small modules, pressurized passageways, support systems, and cargo containers, all wrapped in a flexible fabric outer layer.
In order to keep the fabric shell under tension and to provide some mechanical dampening, the central spine has a thin nitrogen atmosphere, pressurized up to 0.1atm.

While the Lazy Susan does carry cargo, this is only an incidental part of its economy.
Its primary industries are aerospace design, fashion, and banking.
Notably, when it left the LLA, it carried with it a branch of one of the LLA's highly effective banks.
This represents something of a powerful asset, giving the Venusians access to both the Lunar banks' skill at working in the outer-system rep economies, and access to a credit system other than the Consortium's credits.

## Miquelon

| Miquelon | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 17K |
| Languages | French, English, others |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Skyfarer's League |
| Economy | Transitional, Hypercapitalist |

Miquelon is a small aerostat primarily devoted to bio-engineering.
It provides the League with a substantial reserve of scientific and technical expertise.

Before the independence vote, Miquelon was a research installation devoted to the development of the specialized organisms that would be involved in establishing the earliest surface-dwelling biosphere as Venus was terraformed.
The formation of the Morningstar Constellation and the collapse of the terraforming project left the Miquelon economy in dire straits; while Argonaut ties and led them depart the Consortium, resentment kept them from joining the Constellation, and the habitat became independent.
Pragmatism (and a stalling economy) later led them to found the Skyfarer's League, together with Brunswick and Bremerhaven.

Miquelon was originally a research outpost, rather than an civil polity with a developed economy.
While the microcorps and hypercorps of Bremerhaven and Brunswick have begun to put Miquelon's substantial technical talent to work, the transition to a self-sustaining private economy is incomplete, and the habitat still has something of a "college town" atmosphere.
Similarly, while the habitat has completed the transition to civil government, some old academic loyalties and patronages survive, creating something of an informal reputation network.

While a few design teams still work on designer organisms for a "full" terraforming, most have pivoted to other endeavors.
A number of hypercorps have formed to pursue joint projects with Bremerhaven's aerospace industry; these include a major long-term project researching the development of organic or nanotissue aerostats, with the long-term goal being to produce aerostats that are capable of growing, repairing, and modifying themselves.
Others have been recruited for projects in Extropian markets, either on Brunswick itself or through that habitat's ties with the 'Belt.
As Miquelon's economy has diversified, it has also drawn a handful of researchers from other fields.

## Siniyah

| Siniyah | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 6.5K - 8k |
| Languages | English, Arabic, Turkic |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Independant |
| Economy | Transitional, Hypercapitalist |

Siniyah is an independent aerostat owned (indirectly) by the Wells-al-Naar-Iyer family, a small clan of hyper-elites and oligarchs.

The habitat has a "trifoil" design, with three long "petals" extending from a central hub.
Each "petal" sports three gold-colored domes: one large dome on top, and two smaller domes on the bottom.
Each petal is 250m long, and each of the oval domes is roughly 200m long; this makes Siniyah much larger than other independent aerostat.
As on most aerostats, a "bulb" containing the habitat's industrial equipment and material reserves is suspended beneath it, connected by a long, tapering "neck".

Siniyah is private, and access to it is tightly restricted.
Airships are allowed to dock, but only for refueling or maintenance; their crews and passengers are restricted to the docks.
As a result, information about the habitat's layout, population, or facilities is minimal; what little information that is available is gathered from mesh-traffic and civic-net monitoring.

It is believed to house a population of between six and seven thousand people.
Two of the "leaves" appear to be given over to lavish residences for a thousand hyper-elites, plus four thousand people serving as assistants, servants, or workers in the habitat's service industry; the mesh and social-network footprint of these people allows us to be *relatively* confident of the numbers and layout.
It is believed that the rents paid by these tenant hyper-elites are a significant source of income and political support for the Wells-al-Nair-Iyer family.
The third leaf appears to be given over to facilities for the family's private organizations and operations; we have little reliable information about what these may be, although the clan's access to specialized morphs and biotechnology suggest that they include gene-hacking labs, wet-fab facilities, and morph-works.
The fourth habitat dome atop the central hub is conjectured to be a private, ultra-lux residence for the family itself; very little information has escaped this environment.

The aerostat is owned by the Siniyah Holding Company; Ellis and Samira Wells-al-Naar-Iyer, the oligarchs at the center of the family, own a 72% stake in the SHC.
There is a case to be made that the aerostat is therefore in effect a kingdom: while there is a veneer of private ownership and administration using a hypercapitalist model, possession and command of the habitat ultimately traces back to two people, Ellis and Samira Wells-al-Naar-Iyer.
Since the habitat is independent of any other organization, it is ultimately under no authority but theirs.

Notably, despite operating on a hypercapitalist model, both the habitat itself and the Wells-al-Naar-Iyer family are independents; they are members of neither the Planetary Consortium nor the Morningstar Constellations.
It is believed to do business with – and host hyperelite tenants from – both.
This may give the habitat (and its controlling hyper-elite dynasty) access to a broad base of power and support on Venus.

The Wells-al-Naar-Iyer clan's distrust of hackable technology (and external dependencies) has impacted the design of the habitat and its infrastructure.
It is believed that the habitat uses a neural substrate for control, rather than a traditional hab-ops center; unlike outer-system efforts, which use neuromorphic nanotissue, it is believed that Siniyah uses an entirely organic system.
What digital infrastructure they do have appears to be a mix of private in-house software and patched open-source code; they have a deep-seated distrust of software that they do not control that rivals the most paranoid free-software activist.
They also place a heavy emphasis on security, aggressively defending any system that is publicly accessible, and moving anything even remotely sensitive off the public mesh.

Their extreme paranoia in regards to infosec is another reason that relatively little information is known about the hab.
However, it should also be noted that they are limited by the availability of resources; their pool of infosec talent is relatively small, and they simply do not have the resources to re-implement as much of the modern mesh "stack" as they might like.

While the level of secrecy is concerning – to say nothing of the moral discomfort Venusians may feel from sharing the skies with a kingdom – we have no specific information regarding an active X-risk originating from the habitat at this time.
If anything, the clan's distrust of "hackable" technology and their lack of access to a major fighting force (*à la* Direct Action for the Consortium) makes them less likely to pose a threat than other hypercapitalist habitats.
Infiltration efforts are ongoing, but are not a priority at this time.

## The Skyfarer's League

The Skyfarer's League is a loose alliance of three minor aerostats: Bremerhaven, Brunswick, and Miquelon.
These aerostats where carried to independence with the Venusian independence referendum but, for various reasons, chose not to join the Morningstar Constellation.
The League was formed to allow its members to counterbalance the much larger Constellation, and to secure their mutual defense.

The League has four primary responsibilities:

- it maintains its own micro-currency, is empowered to conduct monitary policy, anda may collect taxes;
- it maintains a defense force;
- it establishes treaties;
- and it maintains a common identity system.

It is also empowered to spend funds on other public works and projects.

Member habitats are required to use the League's currency, and to pay taxes; to operate through the League for treaties with other habitats and polities; and to maintain and accurately report identities according to the identity framework.
In all other respects, they are independent and sovereign.
Notably, there is no requirement to use a particular economic or political model (so long as the League's microcurrency is accepted).
This means that there are no restrictions on how habits approve or veto League actions; Bremerhaven and Miquelon grant this power to their elected governors, while Brunswick uses a public vote.
Member habitats may even maintain their own, individual defense forces; currently only Brunswick does this.

The League is led by a unicameral congress, the League Assembly.
Each habitat may appoint one representative per three thousand residents.
(There is no requirement for how member habitats do this; the three current habitats use various elective systems.)
The Assembly then constructs an administration, which oversees the various League agencies.

Accepting new members requires the approval of two-thirds of the member habitats, as does altering the structure of the League.

### Personhood

The League does not specify a definition of personhood, nor does it specify the legal status of AGIs or uplifts.
Instead, each habitat is obligated to honor the other's definitions of personhood and citizenship.

At the time the league was formed, AGIs and Uplifts were second-class citizens on Bremerhaven and Miquelon: they had the status and rights of citizens, but were subject to restrictions and monitoring that transhuman citizens were not.
Brunswick, however, used a roughly Extropian model of personhood: anyone who can consent to contact – including AGIs, uplifts, and possibly others – is recognized as an equal person.
This effectively meant that AGIs and Uplifts would have full personhood within the League as along as Brunswick is a member.

While this was commonly accepted in Bremerhaven and Miquelon, a coalition of mercurials, liberals, and autonomists pushed for a formal guarantee of non-human personhood.
A compromise was struck, in which the League Assembly passed a resolution that formalized the status quo: as long as Brunswick remains a member, their expansive definition of personhood will predominate in the League.

All told, this means that AGIs and Uplifts have full and equal legal status in the League.

### Forking

Brunswick has also effectively determined the League's policies about forking and merging.
Bremerhaven and Miquelon had policies on forking and merging similar to those of the Consortium; Brunswick's are much simpler.
On Brunswick, two egos are considered separate instances of the same person if they both agree that they are; and two egos can merge if they both consent to it.
In most practical cases, this trivial "system" works as well as other habitat's more complex ones; it has also been applied to the League's other members, under the auspices of the shared personhood and identity requirements.

Since full (alpha) and even pruned (beta) forks have full and equal status, many League members rely on ALI-equivalent (delta) forks whenever possible.
When a more complete fork is required, great care is taken when pruning in order to avoid future complications – especially by those who do not trust themselves.

## The Wells-al-Naar-Iyer Family

The Wells-al-Naar-Iyer family are a clan of independent (i.e. outside the Planetary Consortium) oligarchs based chiefly on Venus.
The family is headed by Ellis and Samira Wells-al-Naar-Iyer, a couple hailing from oligarchical dynasties dominant in the worlds of finance in the U.K. and UAE (respectively) more than 60 years before the Fall.
The broader clan includes a collection of their descendants, relations, and family friends.

Unlike ancient feudal societies, the clan does not define itself through title or blood; instead, membership and stakes are mediated through a web of holding companies, hypercorps, and fronts.
This allows the clan to distribute power, prestige, and wealth throughout a large network, and to have fine-grained control over who has ownership, control, or interest in what.
This allows the clan to be relatively stable, to minimize "palace intrigues", and to ensure that a wide web of individuals are "bought in" to the system to at least some degree.
It also allows them to give a relatively wide leash to the members at the edges, while controlling the amount of resources they can waste and the damage that they can do.

One of the centerpieces of the clan's wealth and power is the Siniyah aerostat (described above).
The aerostat is controlled by Ellis and Samira, although indirectly: the aerostat is owned by the Siniyah Holding Company, and Ellis and Samira own a 72% stake in the SHC.
Beyond Siniyah, the family's wealth is principally held by two holding companies: the Wells-al-Naar-Iyer Family Trusts, which are restricted to the clan itself, and the Siniyah Independent Investments, which is owned by the family but open to outside investors.
Being independent, neither investment house is subject to any kind of mandatory disclosure or reporting; the best estimate is that the Family Trust manages upwards of 51B credits, while SII manages upwards of 115B credits, with roughly 46B of that coming from the family itself.

The clan is secretive, and little is known about their affairs, goals, or other holdings.

The clan has an extreme paranoia of infosec threats.
They appear to use neuromorphic and even biological hardware to host infomorphs and control systems, and they appear to prefer highly-transgenic biomorphs for some roles that other factions or parties might use bots for, including security purposes.

There is also some evidence that the clan has developed and circulated some kind of neo-monarchical philosophy.
It appears to reject the chaos and disorder of liberal or autonomist social systems, arguing that "rule by the best" is best able to provide a prosperous and meaningful existence.
They appear to have used this ideology to recruit and indoctrinate followers; it is unknown what they may be organizing these people to do.
