# Independent Habitats and Minor Factions of Venus

The large aerostats of the Morningstar Constellation share the skies of Venus with a number of smaller aerostats.
Some of these are minor members of the Constellation; others are members of other factions, with only a minor presence on Venus; and still others are entirely independent.
Some even have no known identity or affiliation.

## Botany

| Botany | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | 8K |
| Languages | English, Afrikaans, Vietnamese, Arabic |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Independent, Criminal |
| Economy | Mixed |

Botany is a (mostly) gang-held aerostat that operates far from any major aerostat or shipping lane; it provides a haven for Venus's malcontents and criminal element.

Botany was initially constructed in BF 17 as an attempt by a conglomerate of South African and Australian mining corporations, the South-Pacific Corporation for the Development of Venus.
The aerostat they built was sturdily-constructed, and intended mainly for industrial use; this required it to be relatively large, so that it could enclose enough lifting volume to carry the heavy frame and industrial equipment.
At the same time, it was lightly populated, housing a crew of only 190 people.
However, within a decade, rapid improvements in nanofabrication rendered much of the existing industrial equipment obsolete; at the same time, increases in the number of people accepting indentures to get off Earth led to the original workforce slowly being replaced by people who were effectively slaves.

Discharged workers often had nowhere else to go; attempts to evict them were practical death sentences.
Because of this, they often encountered significant resistance, which frequently turned violent.
Riots began to break out in the later months of BF 12, leading to a wildcat strike in early BF 11.
Organized strikes and disorganized riots continued to break out for the next several years, culminating in BF 8 when the aerostat's overseers were overthrown and the SPCDV's loyalists and enforcers were thrown overboard.
The hastily-organized union then entered into direct negotiations with the SPCDV; rather than negotiate with the union, the SPCDV shifted their focus to newer aerostats – aerostats which did not need extensive refits or updates, and that did not have embedded local populations that the SPCDV did not control.

This also left Botany without an economy or primary industry.
An operating agreement was struck with the SPCDV, which allowed Botany to limp along; under the agreement, in exchange for a relative pittance and access to the SPCDV's internal markets, the aerostat stored surplussed equipment, provided manufacturing support during emergencies, and served as a punishment detail for problem employees from other operations.
Botany had been frozen out of most of the early hypercapitalist markets, leading to chronic shortages.
Early nanofabrication had at least made it to the aerostat; the habitat's residents broke down several large pieces of industrial machinery, and retrofitted the aerostat to support its much larger population.
The union had substantially failed to improve local conditions, and had lost public support; lacking any other power structure, gangs had begun to spring up.

When the Fall came, the SPCDV was substantially wiped out, abruptly leaving Botany independent.
By that time, a balance of power had emerged between the largest gangs on the habitat, the remnants of the original union movement, and a nascent punk-anarchist movement.
After the Fall, the arrangement was formalized: in AF 3, the Botany Truce was struck between the habitat's four largest gangs, the remnants of the Botany Union, and the "Live from the Skies over Hell", the largest punk-anarchist (what we now call the Scum) community on the hab.

In the years since the Fall, the communities on Botany have connected with external communities – the gangs making connection with other criminals and gangs on Venus, and the Botany Union and Scum reaching out to contacts in the outer system.
And modern nanofabrication finally came to Botany, leading to substantial updates to much of the habitat's infrastructure and making local life much less desperate.

Today, Botany has become something of a nexus for criminals and outsiders on Venus.
Botany hosts a substantial number of hackers, so the local digital piracy scene flourishes.
Cracked apps and blueprints, current exploits, stolen data, and backdoors are all available.
Botany is also something of a nexus of smuggling on Venus, with countless stolen or illegal goods up for sale in its markets.
The habitat also offers a number of illicit services.
The Scum offer any number of hedonistic pursuits, mediated only by consent, while criminal gangs offer darker services – a notable example being the SP Crew, an especially brutal gang that specializes in strike-breaking.
While soul-traders have been substantially kept away from Botany, the habitat also hosts Ereshkigal, a black-market psychosurgeon notable for her willingness to do anything to any ego, subject only to payment.
She is also notable for her entourage, which is also a demonstration of power: she is escorted by eight people whose egos she accessed and conditioned for complete obedience.

## Bremerhaven

Bremerhaven is minor aeorstat whose primary industry is ship-building.
It provides the Skyfarer's League – as well as other independent aerostats – with the ability to design and construct new airships.

The habitat hosts a number of hypercorps designed in aerospace design and construction, as well as a number of dockyards and construction facilities; several detached airship drydocks also float nearby.
Notably, the habitat is the primary point of construction for the *Osprey*, a small fighter-drone used by the League for defense.
It is also involved in a collaborative project with Miquelon, designing self-growing and self-modifying airships using technologies similar to those used in Hamilton cylinders.

## Brunswick

| Brunswick | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | Variable; 5K permanent, up to 7K visitors |
| Languages | English, Spanish, Greek |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Morningstar Constellation |
| Economy | Transitional |

Brunswick, named after a town in the pre-Fall south-eastern United States, is a member of the Skyfarer's League.
The habitat uses a left-minarchist scheme that verges on mutualism, and it has strong ties to mutualist habitats in the main belt.
Like many Extropian habitats, Brunswick is something of an open market; anything that cannot be found there can be imported from the 'belt.

Brunswick's minarchist scheme mirrors many mutualist communities.
While the habitat has a civilian government, it has a very limited set of roles:

- they administer the habitat's major infrastructure, and maintain their public systems, like public fabbers;
- they operate the habitat's civil defense force;
- they run a minimal police and judicial system, which is mainly intended to oversee the network of dispute-resolution organizations;
- and they oversee the habitat's minimum-income scheme.

For everything else, residents rely on private contracts within the habitat's markets.

## Calypso

| Calypso | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |
| Gravity | Venus gravity (0.9G) |
| Population | Variable; 5K permanent, up to 7K visitors |
| Languages | English, Spanish, Greek |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Morningstar Constellation |
| Economy | Transitional |

*Calypso* is a minor member of the Morningstar Constellation, closely associated with Octavia.

It began life during the Fall, when it was constructed to receive refugees from the Fall.
After the Fall, the habitat became a possession of Octavia, in a deal that gave the aerostat access to money and resources for development it would not otherwise have had – and made it relatively easy for a portion of the population to move to Octavia, to benefit from the more vibrant economy.
It was retrofitted and upgraded during AF 3; after it relaunched, it began to host a number of luxury and service hypercorps.
Calypso was carried into the Morningstar Constellation when Octavia left the Planetary Consortium in AF 6; in turn, Calypso voted to separate from Octavia in AF 7, becoming an independent member of the Morningstar Constellation.
Since then, the aerostat has operated independently, with an economy largely focused on tourism and luxury – although it a member of the Morningstar Constellation, and it remains closely associated with Octavia.

The habitat is something of a storm-chaser; it is willing to approach large cloud formations much more closely than most other aerostats – sometimes ranging quite far afield to do so, and sometimes passing through the storms it pursues.
While this can provide particularly breathtaking vistas, it also means that the habitat often closely approaches storms, and is exposed to risks that other aerostats would avoid.
For this reason, the habitat is more heavily-reinforced than many other small aerostats usually are, and that it also has particularly large and powerful electrofan motors.

Physically, the habitat has something of a "double teardrop" shape, with the large, spherical upper module smoothly tapering to a slender "neck," then expanding to a smaller lower module.
The upper module is larger, roughly 300m in radius, and contains the living and working spaces.
The lower module is smaller, about 125m in diameter and contains the habitats material reserves, bulk storage, support systems, and their few industrial centers.
The smaller module is of course much denser than the upper one, and serves to counter-weight it, keeping the habitat upright.
The whole habitat is roughly 700m high.

The hull of the habitat is made of a doped aluminum-oxide – which the locals often refer to as "sapphire," even though it isn't blue.
Instead, it is a translucent ochre, matching the color of the Venusian atmosphere.
The large observation blisters are doped differently, making them significantly more transparent, providing tourists an astonishing view of the Venusian skies.

The upper module contains eight large terraces, in a "1-3-3-1" layout – one on bottom, forming a torus around the central support pylon that feeds into the connecting neck; three below the "equator" of the habitat, with large, transparent blisters looking downward; three above the "equator", with large blisters looking upward; and one on top, with a blister looking towards the sky.
While the layouts of the terraces are different, most are laid out like deformed cylinders, and most are roughly 150m in diameter, and roughly 40m high at the center.
They are laid out with various environments, 
(Notably, each of the large terraces is designed to be sealed in emergencies, as is the central column within the upper sphere module.)

It's something of an open secret that the habitat has a notable secondary industry.
Calypso has relatively robust privacy laws, sometimes ranges far from other aerostats – sometimes even wandering out of mesh contact, and has a relatively "flexible" approach to many of the Constellation's financial reporting laws; for all of these reasons, it also serves as something of hypercorporate tax haven.

> **anarcat**: "Hypercorporate tax haven" is just the well-supported part.
> Less credible rumors run from the reasonable – secret disaster-recover backups, compute facilities, maybe even quantum-computing centers – to the absurd, like secret labs or Factor toe-holds.
>
> **RategoryTheory**: A quantum-compute center is an interesting idea.
> Quantum computing is a mature-enough technology that you could set up a useful QC facility with relatively little outside talent or special equipment, and an out-of-the-way QC center set up somewhere with lax reporting could be useful for the Constellation too.

> **anarcat**: And a secret lab seems fairly unlikely.
> They don't have the local talent to construct or operate such a facility, and the risk of putting some kind of exotic research facility in a high-traffic civilian habitat is… significant.

## Lazy Susan

| Lazy Susan | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Spaceship; Module hab, with two toruses |
| Gravity | 0.5G and 0.25G |
| Population | 30K |
| Languages | Mandarin, Hindi, German, French |
| Location | Mobile |
| Faction | Morningstar Constellation |
| Economy | Transitional, Mixed |

The Lazy Susan is an unusual, large construction that blurs the line between spacecraft and habitat.
The 'Susan consists of two large centrigrav habitats, connected by a central structure, and propelled by a large fusion motor.

The Lazy Susan was created when two torus habitats voted to leave the LLA and join the Morningstar Constellation.
They lined the habitats up, connected them with a superstructure running through their central hubs, mounted a fusion motor and one end, departed the Earth-Luna L1 point for Venus.
When they arrived at Venus, they joined the Morningstar Constellation, but they did not dismantle the superstructure and "settle" in Venusian orbit; instead, they remain a large spacecraft – boasting two large toruses and a population of 5 thousand people – traveling routes within the inner system.

Physically, the Lazy Susan consists of two older toruses, connected by a central spire or structure.
The front torus was of Chinese construction, built in BF 46, roughly 550m in radius and spun to 0.5g; the rear torus was of Indian construction, built in BF 42, roughly 475m in radius, and spun to 0.25g.
The central spine is 1,175m long; it consists of a sturdy framework, strung with small modules and cargo, wrapped in a flexible fabric outer layer.
In order to keep the fabric shell under tension and to provide some mechanical dampening, the central spine has a thin nitrogen atmosphere, pressurized up to 0.1atm.

While the Lazy Susan does carry cargo, its primary industries are aerospace design, fashion, and banking.
Notably, when it left the LLA, it carried with it a branch of one of the LLA's highly effective banks.
This represents something of a powerful asset, giving the Venusians access to both the Lunar banks' skill at working in the outer-system rep economies, and access to a credit system other than the Consortium's credits.

## Siniyah

| Siniyah | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Aerostat |

| Population | 6K - 7K |

| Economy | Transitional, Hypercapitalist |

Siniyah is an independent aerostat owned (indirectly) by the Wells-al-Naar-Iyer family, a small clan of hyper-elites and oligarchs.

The habitat has a "trifoil" design, with three long "petals" extending from a central hub.
Each "petal" sports three gold-colored domes: one large dome on top, and two smaller domes on the bottom.
Each petal is 250m long, and each of the oval domes is roughly 200m long; this makes Siniyah much larger than other independent aerostat.
As on most aerostats, a "bulb" containing the habitat's industrial equipment and material reserves is suspended beneath it, connected by a long, tapering "neck".

The habitat is private, and access to it is tightly restricted.
Airships are allowed to dock, but only for refueling or maintenance; their crews are restricted to the docks, however, and no other public access is granted.
As a result, information about the habitat's layout, population, or facilities is minimal.

It is believed to house a population of between six and seven thousand people.
Two of the "leaves" appear to be given over to lavish residences for a thousand other elites, plus four thousand people serving as assistants, servants, or working in the habitat's service industry; though tightly controlled, the mesh and social-network footprint of these people allows us to be *relatively* confident of the numbers and layout.
It is believed that the rents paid by these tenant hyper-elites are a significant source of income and political support for the Wells-al-Nair-Iyer family.
The third leaf is appears to be given over to facilities for the family's private organizations and operations; we have little reliable information about what these may be, although the clan's access to specialized morphs and biotechnology suggest that they include gene-hacking facilities, wet-fab facilities, and morph-works.
The fourth habitat dome atop the central hub is conjectured to be a private, ultra-lux residence for the family itself.

The aerostat is owned by the Siniyah Holding Company; Ellis and Samira Wells-al-Naar-Iyer, the oligarchs at the center of the family, own a 72% stake in the SHC.
There is a case to be made that the aerostat is therefore in effect a kingdom: while there is a veneer of private ownership and administration using a hypercapitalist model, possession and command of the habitat ultimately traces back to two people, Ellis and Samira Wells-al-Naar-Iyer.
Since the habitat is independent of any other organization, it is ultimately under no authority but theirs.

While the level of secrecy is concerning – to say nothing of the moral discomfort from sharing the skies with a kingdom – we have no specific information regarding an active X-risk originating from the habitat at this time.
If anything, the clan's distrust of "hackable" technology and their lack of access to a major fighting force (*à la* Direct Action for the Consortium) makes them less likely to pose a threat than most other hypercapitalist habitats.
Infiltration efforts are ongoing, but are not a priority at this time.
