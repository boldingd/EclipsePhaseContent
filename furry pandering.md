## 'Ware

### Frame Adjusting

A more limited form of shape-changing technology, *frame-adjusting* morphs or gear use "conventional" materials and flexible construction (reconfigurable skeletons, hyperflexible joints, and so on) instead of meta-materials to achieve their effect.

The major downside is that the range of configurations that they can assume is typically far more limited.
Wheres proper shape-adjusting morphs can achieve dramatic changes in configuration, frame-adjusting morphs and gear can switch only between the few configurations that they are designed for.
There are two significant upsides, however: frame-adjusting morphs are significantly cheaper, and they can often adjust their shapes much more quickly (typically as a quick action).
Especially skilled operators can even adjust their morph's frames as part of other movements (adjust as free action while taking an action to move; imposes a -10 *distraction* penalty to all actions 'till start of next turn).

- Type: Gear (cyberware)
- Available: Common \[Medium\]

### Furry Mod Pack

Furry mods exist for a number of common morphs, especially low- and midrange synthmorphs.
They are usually entirely cosmetic, although some may include sensory packages, claws, or other minor hardware.

- Type: Gear (cyberware)
- Includes: Synthetic Mask (if Synth), Bodysculpting, Tail, up to two Enhanced Senses, claws
- Available: Common \[Medium\]

### Gum

"Gum" is a meta-material designed to mimic a texture somewhere between rubber and flesh; the intent is to mimic a particular art style that was used in some early "computer-generated" animations.
It has subtle sub-surface lighting effects, like skin, but is typically smooth and hairless, a bit like rubber.

Much like a squishbot, synthmorphs equipped with gum cannot mount some robot frame upgrades â€“ including armor mods, other exterior upgrades (like invisible metamaterials) and some propulsion systems (unless they are on retractable mounts).
However, also like squishbots, they can mount some upgrades only available to biomorphs, including *chameleon skin* and *bioweave armor*.
Biomorphs with Gum also benefit from slightly higher armor ratings; they gain +2E/+2K armor (which stacks with any other armor mods they take, and any worn armor).

- Type: Gear (nanoware)
- Available: Furry Subculture \[Low\], Brony Subculture \[Low\]

### Omnihands

Omnihands are *frame-adjusting* cyberware hands with the ability to assume several configurations.
Most can switch between hands (with one or two thumbs), hooves, or claws (like a crab's); changing configuration takes a *quick action*.

- Type: Gear (cyberwear)
- Available: Furry Subculture \[Low\], Brony Subculture \[Low\]
