# EclipsePhaseContent

This is a repo for some of my Eclipse Phase content.

I was one of two GMs in an Eclipse Phase game that ran, in various forms, from around 2012 to 2021.
World-building was my favorite part, so, over that time, I wrote up a bunch of neat (if I say so myself) space-stations, ships, and minor factions.
I've decided to share write-ups for them, which I'm hosting here.

This repository is mainly for development, so it includes notes and scripts that are not particularly intended for public use.
At some later point, I'll set up a website to host the intended content as HTML.

I am the primary author and license-holder.
I've used several of my players' characters, and I've included some lines and feedback provided by the same.
In particular, I'd like to thank

- SeaVea for large amounts of feedback and help, and advice on how to portray Bauble in particular.
- King K for feedback on several of the documents, and several good lines for 0514NOMAD.
- Acierocolotl for help with Quebecois idiom.
