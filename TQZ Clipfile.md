They are geographically very scattered; they coordinate using their own social network, and they rely heavily on it (and a secure, distributed storage system) for record-keeping, task-tracking, communication, reputation tracking, decision making, and voting.



The Coop is a volunteer group, with very little permanent infrastructure and very few “full time” members.
Most tasks are undertaken as they become necessary and as time permits, by the people and organizations that are in a position to handle them.

Major tasks and ongoing operations are tackled by dedicated working-groups.
Permanent working groups currently exist to maintain and secure the GC social network; to develop defenses against TITAN threats; to secure and distribute necessary military hardware; and to train members in the skills they need, since most volunteers do not have military training.



Both members and working-groups are given great freedom in how they operate, especially during actual "field operations"; the coop has no command structure to provide orders, and few hard rules or procedures.
It does, however, review members' conduct and performance after the fact, collect feedback from civilians that members interact with after the fact, and keep extensive records; it also tracks members feedback, performance, and reputation over the long-run.
In order both to maintain public trust (and to ensure that they remain responsible to the people of Mars), the Coop makes much of this information public.
