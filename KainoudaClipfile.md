These entities — the lending banks, capital banks, and those leasing facilities — together with several microcorps that the Cooperative contracts with to provide services to members, are referred to as Special Status Entities.
Owing to their special status in the Cooperative, they are subject to regulation and inspection.



The Thistledown also has not expropriation requirement.
Members may hold whatever assets they wish in outside economies — and whatever personal property they wish within the Cooperative — so long as they meet all their obligations to the Cooperative.
