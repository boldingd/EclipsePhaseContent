# The Skyward Collective

The Skyward Collective is a social-anarchist cooperative consisting of a number of allied habitats.
They're notable for their particular brand of hedonist collective anarchism, for their efforts at building new habitats and morphs, and for their advocacy for experimentation with safe seed AIs and super-intelligences.

It should be noted early that, because of their preference for ad-hoc organization, different Skyward habs can have very different social structures.
Some habs may have permanent working-groups that others do not; some may have very different lists of allowed nanotechnology; and some even have fundamentally different economic models.

## Founding Values

The Skyward Collective was founded by small cooperative of anarchist thinkers, activists, and partisans operating on an autonomist-aligned habitat in the Jovian Greeks.
It espouses a few core values:

- **Collectivist Anarchism**: the Cooperative strongly supports anarchist social models, egalitarian values, and the collective ownership of all capital;
- **Hedonism**: the Cooperative is very pleasure-oriented, rejecting regimes like work in favor of the pursuit of pleasure;
- **Autonomist Expansion**: the founders of the Cooperative where very concerned that the Planetary Consortium was reinstantiating Fall infugees and integrating them into their society at a much higher rate than the members of the Autonomist Alliance, and wished to create a system that could rapidly absorb and indoctrinate both Fall infugees and the inner-system poor;
- **Tehcnological Progressivism**: the founders saw improving technology as a vital tool both for improving their own lot without the need for labor, and for competing with the Planetary Consortium;
- **Precautionism**: in the aftermath of the Fall, however, the founders also saw a compelling need to ensure that new and powerful technologies did not pose a direct risk to society.

They developed a form of hedonistic collective anarchism that emphasized these principles, successfully incorporated their own habitat using the scheme, and began to establish other collectives using the same scheme in other habitats.

## Society

The Cooperative is set up as an alliance of smaller collectivist cooperatives.
Each member cooperative has near-complete autonomy; while they share social networks, each habitat is allowed to govern itself as it sees fit.
The only requirement is to preserve collective ownership of capital and direct-democratic governance.
Only conflicts between habitats are subject to votes of the entire Skyward Collective; the ultimate level of appeal for all "local" matters is a direct-democratic polling of all residents of the habitat concerned.
Of course, the individual habitats can vary quite a bit in culture, norms, and organization.

Each individual habitat establishes collective ownership of all capital â€” by a fairly expansive definition that allows little room for personal property.
Member cooperatives generally opt for low labor requirements over high productive output: they broadly use the same types of automated resource-extraction and minifacturing that other societies use, but they generally don't supplement it with transhuman labor.
Each member of the cooperative is granted a portion of the resources (feed-stock and energy) produced by the collective, public fabber time to produce their needs and wants, and housing on their habitats; their obligations in turn are minimal (besides surrendering all capital).

Each habitat in the cooperative is administered as an ad-hoc direct-democracy.
They use on-line polling of the entire hab population to make major decisions, while members form "working groups" to make smaller decisions and tackle ongoing problems.
They prefer ad-hoc forms of social-organization and decision-making to fixed institutions and rules, creating working-groups as the need arises, and dissolving the working groups when the issue is resolved. 
In principle, the cooperative attempts to keep formal structures (like the working-groups) to a minimum; in practice, most habitats establish a certain number of permanent working-groups, with set internal structure, to tackle important concerns like hab-maintenance or a civil justice.

Absent these two mechanisms, there is no formal government or rule-making: individuals are free to conduct their affairs as they see fit.

Obviously, not all tasks can be taken care of by automation: volunteers are rewarded with a slight bump in resource allocation and fabber priority queues.
When not enough qualified volunteers can be recruited, individuals can be obligated to service; however, the community tends to avoid obligating members to service, so they keep their labor requirements to an absolute minimum.

Owing largely to their low-to-zero labor expectation, the cooperative tends not to be very productive.
For comparison, per-capita resource allocations sit between one-half and one-third of the median resources consumed by a citizen of the Titanian Commonwealth, depending somewhat on the specific habitat and time.

Their culture is social and hedonistic.
Resource allocations afford a comfortable-if-not-luxurious standard of living, and little is required of individual members; this means that individual members have lots of time to pursue their own interests â€” which often means sex, drugs and parties.
They also tend to have a progressive-precautionist view of technology â€” they believe in both the long-term capabilities of technology to transform people and society for the better, but also in the need to ensure the safety, beneficial use and equitable distribution of those technologies before they are deployed.

### "Economy," Capital, and Fabbing

The Skyward Collective has a fairly strict communist scheme: allowed personal property is very narrowly construed, consisting mostly of clothing, furniture, pieces of art, and personal effects, and everything else is owned collectively by the Cooperative.
Notably, this means that almost all of the habitat infrastructure and productive technology is owned and administered by the cooperative: hab hulls, life support and power systems, resource drones, maintenance drones, and auto-manufacturing systems are all owned by the cooperative.
Notably, all nanofabricators are collectively owned.

Unlike most other Autonomist groups, owing to their socially-conscious and precautionist views, the Skyward Collective restricts and tracks its members use of nanofabrication â€” they believe that each cooperative has a legitimate interest in preventing members from producing grenades, nano-plagues, weapons of mass destruction, or other dangerous technologies.
Public nanofabricators will only produce blueprints approved and signed by the community (and private ownership of CMs is not allowed).
Libraries of such blueprints are made available to members, covering a wide variety of food, clothing, furniture, and useful technologies; members can request anything for the library and, subject to their resource limits, it will be manufactured by a nearby public CM and either delivered by a drone or held for pick-up.

On most habitats, a permanent working-group is responsible for vetting and signing blueprints, and for maintaining the public fabrication network.
Like most other work-groups, these groups make as much of their process public as possible â€” although, for obvious reasons, they typically will not publish blueprints that they reject for signing.
Also like most other work-groups, a vote of the general population can overturn these groups' decisions, although this rarely happens.
(Although it is a point of conflict with many other anarchist groups, precautionist viewpoints are fairly well-entrenched in Skyward habs, and most people support the idea of blocking public fabbers from producing grenades, seeker-launchers, and other destructive devices.)

A few additional blueprints are made available only to Trustees, or are reserved for members of specific working-groups; additionally, a small number of potentially-abusable blueprints are restricted from members flagged as being *antisocial*.

The Cooperative also maintains large nanofabbing and conventional minifacturing facilities on several of its habs, the former for the production of large hardware (like habitat systems) and the latter for manufacturing common objects (like clothing, furniture, tableware and tools) more efficiently than on-demand nanofacture.

Their economy has a very low per-capity productivity â€” another aspect of their "responsible socialist hedonism."
The feelings tends to be, "we have enough for everyone to be comfortable, as long as no-one gets greedy," where there is a particular stigma attached to "being greedy".
Most of their habitats sport sufficient automated resource-gathering and industry to provide their members a comfortable (if not luxurious) standard of living, and most members are satisfied with that, more or less.
Notably, their particular strict-socialist scheme is not set up to encourage members to be much more productive, since any additional resources or capital they produce would be yielded to the Cooperative to be equitably distributed.
(In the minds of the founders of the Skyward Collective, at least, this is a feature rather than a bug; they tend to place a high premium on equitable distribution, and to have a dim view of excess and waste.)

While the distinction may be minor, Skywards is technically a command economy, rather than a reputation economy.
While the Collective does administer a social network and keep reputation scores, these do not primarily determine each individuals resource allocations; rather, each member receives an equal base resource payout, potentially with any resource bumps earned by volunteering for a task from a work-queue.
Beyond the operations of drones, auto-manufacturies and public fabbing, very little economic activity occurs, and so there is very little economic organization to speak of.
