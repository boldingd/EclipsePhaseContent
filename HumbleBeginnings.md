# Humble Beginnings

Humble Beginnings is an social-anarchist cooperative based in the Jovian Greeks.
They're notable for their particular brand of hedonist social-anarchism, for their efforts at building new habitats and morphs, and for their adovacy for experimentation with safe seed AIs and super-intelligences.

## Society

Humble Beginnings use a hedonist, social-anarchist scheme.
The basic philosophy is similar to the Scum: essentially, "we have the resources and technology to live forever, and we have good enough automation that we don't need to work — so we should enjoy it."

Formally, the cooperative establishes collective ownership of all capital — by a fairly expansive definition that allows little room for personal property.
The Cooperative generally opts for low labor requirements over high productive output: they broadly use the same types of automated resource-extraction and minifacturing that other societies use, but they generally don't suppliment it with transhuman labor.
Each member of the cooperative is granted an allowence of the resources (feed-stock and energy) produced by the collective, public fabber time to produce their needs and wants, and housing on their habitats; their obligations in turn are minimal (besides surrending all capital).

The collective is run as an ad-hoc direct-democracy: major decisions are made by on-line polling of the populace, with members forming "working groups" to resolve issues or tackle larger projects.
Absent these two mechanisms, there is no formal government or rule-making; individuals are free to conduct their affairs as they see fit (athough in practice, many habitats have a permanent "Justice" working-group, that serves a purpose somewhat like an ad-hoc court).
Obviously, not all tasks can be taken care of by automation: volunteers are rewarded with a slight bumb in resource allocation and fabber priority queues; but, when not enough qualified volunteers can be recruited, individuals can be obligated to service.

Their culture is social and hedonistic.
Resource allocations afford a comfortable-if-not-luxurious standard of living, and little is requried of individual members; this means that individual members have lots of time to pursue their own interests — which often means sex, drugs and parties.
They also tend to have a precautionist view of technology — they believe in both the long-term capabilities of technology to transform people and society for the better, but also in the need to ensure the safety, beneficial use and equitable distribution of those technologies in the short-term.

### "Economy," Capital and Fabbing

Humble Beginnings has a fairly strict socialist scheme: allowed personal property is very narrowly construed, consisting mostly of clothing, furniture, pieces of art, and personal tokens, with verything else owned collectively by the Cooperative.
Notably, all nanofabricators are collectively owned.

Unlike most other Autonomist groups, owing to their socially-conscious and precautionist views, Humble Beginnings restricts and tracks its members use of nanofabrication — they believe that the Cooperative has an interest in preventing members from producing grenades, nano-plagues, weapons of mass destruction, or other dangerous technologies.
Public nanofabricators will only produce blueprints approved and signed by the community — and private ownership of CMs is not allowed.
Libraries of such blueprints are made available to members, covering a wide variety of food, clothing, furniture, and useful technologies; members can request anything for the library and, subject to their resource limits, it will be manufactured by a nearby public CM and either delivered by a drone or held for pick-up.

A few additional blueprints are made available only to Trustees or are held by specific working-groups, and a small number of potentially-abusable blueprints are restricted from Antisocial members.

The Cooperative also maintains large nanofabbing and conventional minifacturing facilities, the former for the production of large hardware (like habitat systems) and the latter for manufacturing common objects (like clothing, furniture, tableware and tools) more efficiently than on-demand nanofacture.

Their economy has a very low per-capity productivity — another aspect of their "responsible socialist hedonism."
The feelings tends to be, "we have enough for everyone to be comfortable, as long as no-one gets greedy," where there is a particular stigma attached to "being greedy".
Most of their habitats sport sufficient automated resource-gathering and industry to provide their members a comfortable (if not luxurious) standard of living, and most members are satisfied with that, more or less.
Notably, their particular strict-socialist scheme is not set up to encourage members to be much more productive, since any additional resources or capital they produce would be yielded to the Cooperative to be equitably distributed.
(In the minds of the founders of Humble Beginnings, at least, this is a feature rather than a bug; they tend to place a high premium on equitable distribution, and to have a dim view of excess and waste.)
