The Skyward Collective is an anarchist-communist cooperative consisting of a number of allied habitats.
They're notable for their particular brand of hedonist collective anarchism, for their efforts at building new habitats and morphs, and for their advocacy for experimentation with safe seed AIs and super-intelligences.

> **anarcat**: Yeah, I feel like there's definitely going to be one main reason that we're interested in these folks.
>
> **BerkeleyMew**: You're telling me.

It should be noted early that, because of their preference for ad-hoc organization, different Skyward habs can have very different social structures.
Some habs may have permanent working-groups that others do not; some may have very different lists of allowed nanotechnology; and some even have fundamentally different economic models.

> **Padre**: "Allowed nanotechnology?"
> Isn't that unusual for circle-A groups?
>
> **Bauble**: Yes, and yes.
> We'll get into it.

The Collective was established 17 months after the TITANs' disappearance, with the intent of counter-balancing the much greater rate at which the Capitalist polities of the Inner System were capable of resleeving infugees.
(As a point of trivia, it was originally named after its founding habitat, Humble Beginnings.
Later, for different reasons, both were renamed, the hab to √âgalit√© and the Collective to Skyward.)

## Founding Values

The Skyward Collective was founded by small cooperative of anarchist thinkers, activists, and partisans operating on an autonomist-aligned habitat in the Jovian Greeks.
It espouses a few core values:

- **Collectivist Anarchism**: the Cooperative strongly supports anarchist social models, egalitarian values, and the collective ownership of all capital;
- **Hedonism**: the Cooperative is very pleasure-oriented, rejecting regimes like work in favor of the pursuit of pleasure;
- **Autonomist Expansion**: the founders of the Cooperative where very concerned that the Planetary Consortium was reinstantiating Fall infugees and integrating them into their society at a much higher rate than the members of the Autonomist Alliance, and wished to create a system that could rapidly absorb and indoctrinate both Fall infugees and the inner-system poor, and could rapidly acquire and populate habitats;
- **Tehcnological Progressivism**: the founders saw improving technology as a vital tool both for improving their own lot without the need for labor, and for competing with the Planetary Consortium;
- **Precautionism**: in the aftermath of the Fall, however, the founders also saw a compelling need to ensure that new and powerful technologies did not pose a direct risk to society.

They developed a form of hedonistic collective anarchism that emphasized these principles, successfully incorporated their own habitat using the scheme, and began to establish other collectives using the same scheme in other habitats.

Notably, some of these principles set them apart from other Autonomist groups.
For example, most outer-system habitats tend more towards libertarian socialism than anarchist communism, and most autonomist groups strongly support freedom of nanofabrication.

> **RategoryTheory**: And the difference between "libertarian socialism" and "anarchist communism" would be‚Ä¶?
>
> **anarcat**: A fight that we don't need to have, I'm going to say, before Gunslinger decides to "help".

## The Structure of the Collective

The Skyward Collective is itself a federation of smaller collectives, with each member collective usually representing a single habitat or community.

The collective as such is not a government, and does not control the individual habitats; instead, it serves to provide mutual aid, to arbitrate resource sharing, to facilitate members moving between the individual habitats, and to pool resources and coordinate the collectives' efforts to acquire new habitats.

The collective does oversee the acquisition and population of new habitats, and the establishment of new collectives; because it oversees how new collective are established, it does tend to be able to ensure that most habitats start out "on the straight and narrow."

The overarching Skyward Collective does, however, have certain requirements that an individual member collective must meet to remain a *member in good standing*; these include the collective ownership of capital, direct-democratic government, and an impartial justice system.
While an individual habitat could choose to leave the collective ‚Äî or to violate these requirements and be expelled ‚Äî this has not yet happened; this is likely to due to the care that the Skyward Collective takes in constituting and populating new habitats, the benefits of remaining within the collective, and cultural connections between different habitats.

Notably, the over-arching Skyward Collective can intervene in the event of a conflict between different habitats.
When settling a dispute between member collectives, or voting to expel a collective, a two-thirds vote among the *entire* membership of the Skyward Collective is required.
(The final level of appeal for all "local" matters is a direct-democratic polling of the entire hab populace, usually requiring either a simple (one-half) or strong (two-thirds) majority.)

Beyond this, each member collective is given near-complete autonomy, with complete freedom to establish their own norms, assemble their own institutions and conduct their own affairs.

Unsurprisingly, individual habitats can vary quite a bit.

### Expansion

One of the overarching Skyward Collectives major goals is to acquire and populate new habitats.
Unlike most Autonomist organizations, the Skyward Collective aims to expand their reach and grow their numbers, with the specific aim of providing a counter-weight to the inner-system capitalist governments.

The collective's founders where concerned by the much greater rate at which the capitalist economies of the inner-system were resleeving and integrating infugees.
Many outer-system polities, with slower and less-productive economies and lower incentive for growth, only slowly selected and reinstantiated infugee egos; meanwhile, Mars in particular was capable of sustaining a much larger population, the hypercapitalist economy was capable of producing morphs at a much greater rate, and the labor markets of Mars provided a vast demand for new labor.
Therefore, one of their major goals for the Skyward Collective was to create a collectivist-anarchist model that could be implemented throughout the system, and that could rapidly resleeve and integrate infugees, providing the Autonomist Alliance with desperately needed numbers.

At the same time, however, the collective rejects violence and direct confrontation.
It does this for both moral and practical reasons: the Collective could not feasibly defend itself against an attack by either the Planetary Consortium or the Jovian Republic.

In order to expand, the Collective acquires old or abandoned habitats through legitimate means (by whatever definition the "owning" group or polity uses) and establishes new peer collectives in them.
This nonviolent strategy does allow them to avoid outright conflict with existing powers, but it can also subject the collective's colonization efforts to high costs and open-ended delays ‚Äî especially if the current owner's factional government is unwilling to see one of their habitats pass into Autonomist hands.

By working within local legal systems where they exist, the Collective is sometimes able to establish new member collectives "behind enemy lines," within the inner system.
For example, they have purchased a small surface hab on Luna, have occupied an abandoned mining outpost in the inner belt, and have built an improvised "aerostat" on Venus by attaching three large zeppelins and a dozen smaller envelopes to a large mesh.

In principle, membership in a collective is open to anyone; in practice, however, the Collective has a preference for those who lack their own resources, and for those who can be indoctrinated into the Collective's anarchist-communist values.
For this reason, they preferentially recruit from the ranks of Fall infugees, and from the unprivileged and oppressed at the fringes of other societies.

The Collective does usually make an attempt to verify a new member's identity and to check their history, checking relevant reputation scores and verifying brainprint scans when possible (if a record exists, and if the new member consents).
Members are rarely rejected outright.
Instead, new members undergo a short probationary period; those with solid circle-A reputations are put through a shorter probation, while those with "red flags" (or those who lack records) are subject to a longer probationary period.

They also conduct screening for Exsurgent infection; when new members arrive in physical form, they are also checked for physical infection, and for dangerous or proscribed technologies.

> **Bauble**: Their mesh and social-networks are just as transparent as any other anarchist society, and some of their coops have groups that like to point ALIs at those networks to look for signs of infiltration.

So far, despite their goals, their numbers remain relatively small; the entire collective numbers slightly more than 140,000 people (as nearly as can be determined).

### Technology, Research, and Safe Seed AI

The Skyward Collective also maintains a number of working-groups running research projects.
(And somewhat at odds with the society's resource-spare hedonistic norms, some of these working-groups are fairly well resourced.)

The Collective engages in research in automation and ALI development, the better to operate their society in the near-total absence of human labor; and in organic and nano-tissue construction materials for general use.

Very unusually, they are advocates for the development of safe super-intelligence and seed intelligence.
The founders argued ‚Äî and the collective generally accepts ‚Äî that the development of these technologies is inevitable, that their potential is enormous ‚Äî even fundamentally transformative, for both individuals and society ‚Äî and that it can be done safely and equitably.
So far, all of their work is in advocacy and theory ‚Äî they have not resumed experimenting with the technologies that caused the Fall, out of both an extreme concern for safety and deference to the judgement of the broader transhuman community.

Notably, some of their working-groups appear to enjoy both greater access to resources and greater secrecy for their efforts ‚Äî although this is difficult to assess.

### Language

The Skyward Collective is highly polyglot, drawing as it does from fall refugee and infugee populations, and from those at the bottom rungs of other societies.
However, joual, an informal style of Quebecois French, has become the unofficial common language of the collective, owing to the fact that several of the movement's founders hailed from working-class communities in Montreal, and most of their early discussions and documents where written first in idiomatic Quebecois French.
(This is much to the chagrin of those same founders, who wanted to avoid anything so divisive and privileged as an official language.)

> **0514NOMAD**: This explains the uptic of Quebecois idioms I've been seeing on the @-net.
> And here I thought I'd just made that much of an impact‚Ä¶
>
> **Plasmage**: Oh hey, I didn't know  you were Quebecois.
> Maybe you can translate for \@Cur√© when he gets worked up and goes full-French.

> Ontario French is nearly identical, but don't tell any of the boys from Montreal I said that‚Ä¶
>
> **Cur√©**: Hah!
> Too late, we're already here!

A particular variant of Barsoomian is also becoming common ‚Äî "Barsoomian" being the common name for the creole of French and Arabic commonly spoken in the Sufi and Maker communities on Mars.
This is happening in spite of the fact that there are very few native speakers of the language in the collective; instead, it appears to be happening because the language is common enough on the circle-A network, and because it is at least partly intelligible to speakers of both French and Arabic.
(Of course, the Skyward variant is based on Quebecois rather than continental French, and even includes a few English loan-words and idioms.)

Notably, Barsoomian is very difficult to learn, being a very irregular combination of two unrelated languages.
There have been some projects to simplify and standardize the language.
These, in turn, have been met by pushback from the nomadic communities on Mars, who view the effort as a kind of cultural vandalism.
This conflict plays out on Skyward's mesh, as it does throughout the circle-A network.

> **0514NOMAD** It's honestly amazing how deeply the languages of our youth stick with us.

>
> **Plasmage**: Yup, that's about how I thought that'd go.

## Member Collectives

Each individual habitat establishes collective ownership of all capital ‚Äî by a fairly expansive definition that allows little room for personal property.
The output of productive capital is equally distributed by the (local) collective itself; neither currency nor markets are used.
Most systems are automated; where intelligent labor is required, volunteers are typically sought, and reward with (small) resource-allocation bumps.
When required, the Cooperative can compel service: broadly, they can set labor requirements, assign tasks by lottery, or "draft" individuals with unique and necessary skills.

>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Himmel, Arsch, und Zwirn!
> Capitalism's ruined you.
>
> **Bauble**: Usually it's a task-setting working group, sometimes it's a public vote.
> *√âgalit√©* has a bunch of work-groups responsible for different parts of the hab, for example, and they publish task lists.

Member cooperatives generally opt for low labor requirements over high productive output: they broadly use the same types of automated resource-extraction and minifacturing that other societies use, but they generally don't supplement it with transhuman labor.
Each member of the cooperative is granted a portion of the resources (feed-stock and energy) produced by the collective, public fabber time to produce their needs and wants, and housing on their habitats; their obligations in turn are minimal, besides surrendering all capital and answering any labor requirement.

Each habitat in the cooperative is administered as an ad-hoc direct-democracy.
They use on-line polling of the entire hab population to make major decisions, while members form "working groups" to make smaller decisions and tackle ongoing tasks and problems.
They prefer ad-hoc forms of social-organization and decision-making to fixed institutions and rules, using votes to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, creating working-groups as the need arises, and dissolving them when the issue is resolved.
In principle, the cooperative attempts to keep the number and duration of working-groups to a minimum; in practice, most habitats establish a certain number of permanent working-groups, with set internal structures, to tackle important concerns like hab-maintenance or civil justice.

> **anarcat**: This is one of the potential fault-lines for this society, I think.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Yeah, their particular brand of communism holds that kind of "power-collection" is a Bad Thing, as far as I've been able to find.

There is some criticism that the ad-hoc nature of their governance leads to lop-sided and inconsistent outcomes.
The outcome of public debate can depend more on how individuals are perceived than on the details of this specific conflict or the merits of that project.

Absent these two mechanisms, there is no formal government or rule-making: individuals are free to conduct their affairs as they see fit.

Owing largely to their low-to-zero labor expectation, the cooperative tends not to be very productive.
For comparison, per-capita resource allocations sit between one-half and one-third of the median resources consumed by a citizen of the Titanian Commonwealth, depending on the specific habitat and time.

Their culture is social and hedonistic.
Resource allocations afford a comfortable-if-not-luxurious standard of living, and little is required of individual members; this means that individuals have lots of time to pursue their own interests ‚Äî which often means sex, drugs and parties.

Habitats tend to be heavily-populated ‚Äî sometimes overpopulated, by the standards of any society except the Scum.
Reserves are often strained; food, water, and life-support are often prioritized, for obvious reasons, but this often means that Skyward habs do without expensive or resource-intensive technologies or frivolous luxuries.
Carbon allotropes, iron, steel and other conventional materials, and organic components are common instead.
Active meta-materials and cutting-edge server-farms are rare; public, shared facilities like dance-halls, theatres, pubs, and parks are common.

> **H0N3**: If luxuries are rare, how are drugs common?
>
> **Bauble**: There are plenty of party drugs that are simple, organic molecules.
> A CM will make you a gallon of meth or GHB as easily at it'll make you a gallon of soup.
>
> And you can always grow weed, coca, and poppies hydroponically.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: It may not be any of the crazy nanodrugs you can find on the Carnival of the Goat, but some good G wisely and responsibly deployed can make a party.

They also tend to have a progressive-precautionist view of technology ‚Äî they believe in both the long-term capabilities of technology to transform people and society for the better, but also in the need to ensure the safety, beneficial use and equitable distribution of those technologies before they are deployed.
This can lead to provocative and seemingly contradictory positions: the Skyward Collective simultaneously supports research into safe seed intelligences, for example, while also restricting nanofabrication.

### "Economy," Capital, and Fabbing

The Skyward Collective has a fairly strict communist scheme: allowed personal property is very narrowly construed, consisting mostly of clothing, furniture, keepsakes, and personal effects; everything else is owned collectively by the Cooperative.
Notably, this means that almost all of the habitat infrastructure and productive technology is owned and administered by the cooperative: hab hulls, life support and power systems, resource drones, maintenance drones, and auto-manufacturing systems are all owned collectively.
Unlike much of the outer system, all nanofabricators are collectively owned; private ownership of nanofabricators is restricted.

Unlike most other Autonomist groups, owing to their socially-conscious and precautionist views, the Skyward Collective restricts and tracks its members use of nanofabrication.
They believe that each cooperative has a legitimate interest in preventing members from producing grenades, nano-plagues, weapons of mass destruction, or other dangerous technologies.
Public nanofabricators will only produce blueprints approved and signed by the community (and private ownership of CMs is not allowed).
Libraries of signed blueprints are made available to members, covering a wide variety of food, clothing, furniture, and useful technologies; members can request anything from the library and, subject to their resource limits, it will be manufactured by a nearby public CM and either delivered by a drone or held for pick-up.

On most habitats, a permanent working-group is responsible for vetting and signing blueprints, and for maintaining the public fabrication network.
Like most other work-groups, these groups make as much of their process public as possible ‚Äî although, for obvious reasons, they typically will not publish blueprints that they reject for signing.
Also like most other work-groups, a vote of the general population can overturn these groups' decisions ‚Äî although this rarely happens in practice.
(Although it is a point of conflict with many other anarchist groups, precautionist viewpoints are fairly well-entrenched in Skyward habs, and most people support the idea of blocking public fabbers from producing grenades, seeker-launchers, and other destructive devices.)

A few additional blueprints are made available only to *trusted* members, or are reserved for members of specific working-groups; additionally, a small number of potentially-abusable blueprints are restricted from members flagged as being *antisocial*.

The Cooperative also maintains large nanofabbing and conventional minifacturing facilities on several of its habs, the former for the production of large hardware (like habitat systems) and the latter for manufacturing common objects (like clothing, furniture, tableware and tools) more efficiently than on-demand nanofacture.
The collective also makes use of conventional agriculture and hydroponics, both for food (and drug) production and for environmental maintenance; many of their habitats sport large zero-G or low-G hydroponics modules.

Their economy has a very low per-capita productivity ‚Äî another aspect of their "responsible communist hedonism."
Public sentiment runs along the lines of, "we have enough for everyone to be comfortable, as long as no-one gets greedy," where there is a particular stigma attached to "being greedy".
Most of their habitats sport sufficient automated resource-gathering and industry to provide their members a comfortable (if not luxurious) standard of living.
Notably, their particular strict-collectivist scheme is not set up to encourage members to be much more productive, since any additional resources or capital they produce would be yielded to the Cooperative to be equitably distributed.
(In the minds of the founders of the Skyward Collective, at least, this is a feature rather than a bug; they tend to place a high premium on equitable distribution, and to have a dim view of excess and waste.)

While it may be an academic point, Skyward is technically a mix of command and gift economies, rather than a reputation, social-credit, or social-money economy.
While the Collective does administer a social network and keep reputation scores, these do not affect individual members' resource allocations; rather, each member receives an equal base resource payout, potentially with resource bumps earned by volunteering for a task from a work-queue.

Beyond the operations of drones, auto-manufacturies and public fabbing, very little economic activity occurs, and so there is very little economic organization to speak of.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: These guys are old-school, and I might be a fan.
>
> **Bauble**: I'm not a fan of the fab restrictions.
>
> **anarcat**: You can really start to see the ways that these folks don't quite line up with the rest of the Autonomist Alliance.

Some tasks still require skilled labor by individuals.
While member collectives do want to incentivize people to serve the community as doctors, EMTs, advocates, engineers, and technicians, they are extremely reticent to mandate labor, establish hierarchies, or allow the accumulation of capital (physical or social).
For these things, most member collectives use an informal gift system.
Services rendered are tracked as gifts, favors, or contributions; member-collectives then track these gifts on their social network.
Members may then take into account whether someone is contributing to others, or to the community at large ‚Äì or not ‚Äì when dealing with others.

However, there is no obligations that these contributions be repayed, other than that from social convention.
Someone who racks up favors cannot expect to demand repayment, either from individuals or from the community.
This means that especially hard-working or talented individuals often get little direct reward for their labor.
Not only can this discourage contributions, it can also lead to some individuals seeking to sell their skills elsewhere ‚Äì either leading to participation in illicit underground markets, or even to outright departure from the collective.
This in turn can lead to a kind of brain-drain, as the brightest and most industrious in the Collective have an incentive to depart for habitats and polities where their skills will be more highly valued.

### Work-Groups, Trusted Members and the Antisocial

Work-groups are a core feature of the Skyward Collective's social organization.
Work-groups are self-organizing groups of members, formed in order to tackle specific tasks, provide specific services or resolve specific issues.

Most work groups are small and temporary, formed for a particular purpose and dissolved when that purpose is completed; these work-groups are typically informal.
They will operate publicly, they will attempt to secure the involvement of all concerned parties, and their activities will be archived, but they are given no actual authority; it is considered poor form to ignore or subvert a work-group that is managing a certain task, but there is no actual penalty for doing so.

Some work-groups, however, are permanent, and are granted a measure of authority.
Typically, this is done by proposing a charter, which will include a short description of the purpose of the group and its initial operating rules; these charters are then put up to a vote by the whole community, and (typically) must pass with a two-thirds majority.
(Once established, charters can also be modified or recalled by the community, although this often requires a two-thirds majority to achieve.)

There is no particular template for a permanent working-group; they can have very different sizes, authorities, and rules, depending on the tasks they are attempting to accomplish.
Most are allowed fairly wide latitude in their internal arrangement, forming their own rules of order and operating procedures; they are typically expected to make as much of their proceedings public as possible, although some ‚Äî like most Justice working-groups ‚Äî keep large portions of their operations secret; and they typically cannot make major decisions for the hab on their own, instead publishing advisory documents and putting final proposals up for votes.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: A common scheme we saw was creating "planning groups" and then requiring that their proposals get an up-or-down vote before letting people tinker.
> The idea is to try to let experts get first-crack at policy while still being a direct democracy.
>
> **Padre**: How often do advisory-group proposals get overturned?
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Rarely.
> Knowing you're going to have to go through an up-or-down vote of the whole hab tends to keep people from trying to put crazy shit in.
>
> I checked their public records on circle-a, and it looks like they go straight through about sixty percent of the time.
> When they don't, they're usually returned for revision; they only get out-right rejected about five percent of the time.
>
> It's also worth pointing out that public participation tends to be low; on habs without mandatory voting, it's usually between five and twenty percent.
> Unless the word gets out that something major or controversial is about to happen, that can turn into a shit-show.
>
> **anarcat**: Oh yeah, that's pretty familiar.
> My mutualist hab also uses a work-group structure kind of like that, and we also have public vote participation of around twelve percent.
> And the working-group proposals usually go through.

Some working-groups also have access to specialized hardware or blueprints that the general populace may not be allowed; for example, Defense working-groups may have access to military weaponry that the general populace does not.
Some working-groups may also have special authority granted to them or their members; Civil Peace and Justice working-groups, for example, have the power to act as a peace-force and judicial system, respectively, and they can grant the authority to their members to act as peace officers, social workers, public prosecutors, or public defenders.
Many working-groups have internal training and qualification systems; Civil Peace, Civil Justice, Engineering, and Education working-groups all typically train and qualify their members.
(The structure of Education working-groups is interesting: they spend more time on certifying teachers and developing materials than on direct education.
Learning is often undertaken independantly, at the learner's discression.)

Of course, working-groups are as dependent on volunteers as the rest of the collective, and so the amount of training and professional work they can do is limited; still, the permanent working-groups represent a reserve of expertise that many other outer-system autonomist societies fail to establish at all.

Beyond the working-groups, the community can also designate some members as *trusted members*.
As the name implies, *trusted members* have earned the trust of the community; this carries no direct privilege, but it makes them eligible for certain positions of trust that other members do not qualify for.
Some restricted technologies are only available to trusted members; protean swarms, for example, are usually only available to trusted members, and dissassemblers are only available to trusted members in certain work-groups.

Conversely, some members are designated as *antisocial*; this is often done as a temporary measure in response to minor crime, or sometimes in response to consistent, minor antisocial behavior.
Antisocial members *loose* access to some technologies or blueprints, and may suffer other minor disciplinary actions as well.
(Of course, labelling a member as antisocial is not the extent of the Skyward justice system; their Civil Peace and Justice working-groups have access to many of the tools and remedies that other justice systems do.)

### The Justice System

Somewhat like the Titanian Commonwealth, and somewhat unlike most other autonomist groups, most Skyward Collective habitats have justice systems, commonly centered around permanent working groups.
These commonly include "Civil Peace" working-groups tasked with securing public order, "Civil Justice" working groups that function much like courts, and "Civil Support" working-groups that function something like social-workers.
Crucial roles in these groups ‚Äî like that of Peace Officer in a Civil Peace working group, or as an advocate in a Civil Justice group ‚Äî are often reserved for Trusted citizens who earn a Certification with the group.
These groups also often have very detailed public disclosure requirements ‚Äî both for what *must* be disclosed and what *must not*.

The structure of these groups can vary widely from hab to hab, depending on the size of the habitat and the temperament of the residents.
Some smaller habitats will only sport a single Peace, Justice and Aide working-group, possibly consisting of 15 or fewer people, while some larger habitats might split each role into an association of related work-groups.

The Skyward Collective as such requires that each member collective see to public peace, and allows for trial-by-jury of those who abuse others and the potential imprisonment of members who pose a danger to the rest of the collective.
(As elsewhere, a full, direct-democratic poling of the entire habitat is the final recourse of their justice system, with a two-thirds vote required to sustain a conviction.)
However, the abuse, neglect or viovlation of prisoners is also strictly forbidden; prisoners are still members of the collective, and beneficieries of all the rights, priviledges and protections that come with it.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Here's the part I don't like: anarchist cops.
>
> **RategoryTheory**: Yeah, I really don't like the idea of the final appeal for the court system being basically a social-media poll.
> We have shit like *voir dire* for a reason.
>
> **anarcat**: Well, at least they have a justice system.
> Plenty of autonomist habs don't.
>

> *You* don't.
>

>

>
> **RategoryTheory**: At least it's not random strangers voting on whether I'm guilty of murder or not based on my social-media profile.
>
> **Padre**: Well, to be fair, 'cat is an Extropian, so that is an anarchist system.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: "At least."

### Crime

Compared to other societies, crimes of need are rare in Collective habitats, but interpersonal crimes are not.
Offenses, grievances, grudges, and vendettas are as common in the Collective as they are anywhere else.
While the Collective's social and hedonistic tendencies may blunt them somewhat, the crowded nature of their habitats can also amplify them.
Perversely, the lack of a labor requirement may amplify tensions as well; small injuries can fester when nothing prevents a person from obsessing over them.

Within the Collective, many forms of exchange and compensation are either taboo or illegal.
This leads to a somewhat unusual form of crime: underground labor markets.
While information is scarce, a few of them are publically known.
Allegedly, the largest is *le march√© du diable*, an invite-only market burried deep inside encrypted networks and onion-router protocols.
*Le march√©* allows members to exchange goods and services for credit, using a local micro-currency.
An underground economy has forned on *Le march√©*, one that is more productive and profitable than the command/gift economy used by the collective as a whole.
This is a notable source of friction, as those who participate in *le march√©* ‚Äì or at least those who are reputed to ‚Äì slowly become better off than those who do not, which offends the Collective's egalitarian values.

Another, *eumlat alshaytan* ‚Äì devil's coin ‚Äì is a local crypto-currency.
While other local cryptos exist, most of them do not allow outsiders to own or exchange coins ‚Äì whichc keeps them relatively in the Collective's good graces.
The devil's coin, on the other hand, allows outsiders to own and trade tokens, and is listed on cryptocurrency exchanges in the Extropian 'belt and Saturnian orbit.
Because of this, the devil's coin provides a (thin) connection between the underground markets of the Skyward Collective and public markets in the main 'belt and the Titanian Commonwealth.

> **Bauble**: This is a fight between Gunslinger and me.

## Habitats

### √âgalit√©

| √âgalit√© | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Torus (radius 544m) |
| Gravity | 0.75G (centrigrav) |
| Population | 65K |
| Languages | French (Quebecois), English, Barsoomian (Skyward), Mandarin, Arabic, Spanish |
| Location | Jovian Greeks |
| Faction | Autonomist, Skyward Collective |

√âgalit√© is the founding hab for the Skyward Collective, and still its single largest member.

Early on, both the founding cooperative and the entire collective movement had the same name, "*Humble Beginnings*."
During the second year, it was decided allowing the founding hab to share the same name as the whole collective violated the spirit of communist equality; the hab was renamed *√âgalit√©*.
(Four months after that, it was decided that a slightly more stirring ‚Äî and more wieldy ‚Äî name was required for the collective, and it was renamed *Skyward*.)

The 540m-radius torus hab was originally built by a pre-fall hypercorp in an asteroid family in the Jovian Greeks to support mining operations.
It was abandoned by its original hypercorp owner when major mining operations ceased in BF 6.
(It should be noted that the asteroids in the family still contain small veins of metals; mining ceased because the hypercorp could not compete with cheaper metals mined in the primary asteroid belt and inner system.)
The station's next occupants arrived barely three years later, aided by contacts in the former hypercorp owner's administration; this group had formed around a core of anarchist-communist theorists and activists.

Infugee influx during the Fall dramatically expanded their population; during and after the Fall, sleeving, integrating and indoctrinating the new arrivals was a primary concern.
The station's activist founders watched with concern as the Hypercorp Consortium set about combing through the infugee egos that they had received, sleeving them, and integrating them; concern for the Hypercorp Consortium's growing population led the occupants to launch an initiative to similarly grow the Autonomist Alliance's ranks with infugees; and thus the Skyward Collective was born.

√âgalit√© remains the largest and most populous of the Skyward Collective's habs.
√âgalit√© is a torus hab with a radius of 544m, a rim-width of 89m, and a rim-height of 73m; it's spun to three-quarters of G, and a human-baseline environment is maintained inside ‚Äî that is, one atmosphere of pressure, a 24-hour day/night cycle, a temperature between 14C and 27C, and a year-long seasonal cycle.
It currently has a population of 65,000.

> **anarcat**: Just to save you some headache, that's about 1.1 rpm, and a tangential velocity of 63m/s at the rim.
>
> **Bauble**: That population's high for a torus that size.
> They're packed in like we are.

√âgalit√© also retains some of the heavy infrastructure from its former life as a mining outpost; this gives it an ability to mine local asteroids and to produce some larger pieces of equipment.
However, the Trojans in general are relatively metal-poor, and the family of asteroids that √âgalit√© occupipes is "metal rich" only in comparison to the other Trojans ‚Äî is still fairly poor compared to any given metallic asteroid in the main belt.
However, like most of the Jovian trojans, the nearby asteroids are rich in ice, organic compounds, and silicates, meaning that the raw ingrediants for organics (including food and morphs), fuel, environments, carbon allotropes, and computing elements are plentiful.
This means that, much like hydrocarbon-rich Titan, carbon allotropes (like diamond, graphite, graphene, and carbon nanotubes) are commonly used as construction materials in places where inner-system societies would use metals, and that organic, self-growing components are in much greater use.

Despite the hedonist leanings of most of its residents, √âgalit√© has a fairly sophisticated civil society.
They have a number of Working Groups, including several different Task Groups, responsible for various areas of maintenance and hab-operation; large Civil Peace, Justic, and Social Support groups responsible for policing the habitat, prosecuting antisocial elements and providing support to those who are struggling, respectively; a Defence Group Federation that managers several smaller groups responsible for different aspects of the habitat's defence; and several research groups.
The habitat is notable for its particularly sophisticated Justice group, which includes sophisticated rules for trial-by-jury, a second tier of appellate courts for appeals, and the fact that their court system requires a Strong Majority in a public vote to overturn.
All of the judges in their court system are required to be Trusted Members, who must earn a series of Certifications with the work-group.

### Dewi's Refuge

| Dewi's Refuge | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Sub-Surface Cavern (130m diameter) |
| Gravity | 0.166G (lunar gravity) |
| Population | 85 |
| Languages | French, Hindi, Mandarin |
| Location | Luna |
| Faction | Contested: Autonomist, Skyward Collective; Lunar-LaGrange Alliance |

Dewi's Refuge is a small community burrowed into the surface of Luna.
It's named for Suharto Dewi, an Indonesian entrepreneur who constructed the habitat more than forty years before the Fall.
More fortunate than many, Dewi survived the Fall; he decided to sell off the old hab rather than modernise it, and the Skyward Collective purchased it from him.

Complicating matters is that the hab was still occupied, if only by a handfull of people.
The collective has worked hard to win these people over, and has enjoyed some success ‚Äî cancelling rent being an excellent way to make a positive impression on someone ‚Äî but they are not yet confident that they have enough public support to carry a vote to depart the LLA.

For this reason, the factional status of the habitat is disputed.
The LLA accepts that the Skyward Collective (or the shell-company they used to purchase the hab) are the legal owners, and that ultimately they have the right to depart the Alliance; however, not wishing to see a communist presence take hold on Luna, the Alliance has used the presence of "prior Alliance member" residents in the habitat to delay the Collective's taking possession of it.
Complicating matters, it is in principle possible for a habitat to be a member of both the Skyward Collective and the Lunar-LaGrange Alliance at the same time, since the terms of the Alliance do not require that member-habs maintain a capitalist economy or prevent them from joining other organizations; while this is a potential compromise position, it is appealing to neither the LLA nor the Skyward Collective.

Because of the conflicted status, the Collective has refrained from fully occupying the habitat ‚Äî although they have sent in small work-crews, totalling a bit more than 32 people, to continue the maintenance of the hab.
The LLA maintains ‚Äî not without reason  that these are in fact the first permanent occupants of the habitat.

The habitat is small and simply constructed: it consists of a primary chamber, roughly circular, about 130m in diameter, 20m high at the center, and burried 6m down; the center is occupied by a green-space park, a small circulating stream, and public buildings, with private residences and businesses located in modules set into the wall of the chamber.
Five side-tunnles radiate from the central chamber, the longest being about 50m long; these tunnels are lined with smaller modules.

The habitat has living space for a little more than three thousand people ‚Äî assuming needed maintenance and upkeep is performed, and in particular that the life-support systems are modernised.

### Chateau Montgolfier

| Chateau Montgolfier | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | "Gantry" mesh (triangular mesh, 500m to a side) |
| Gravity | 0.91G (venusian gravity) |
| Population | 366 |
| Languages | French, English, German, Arabic |
| Location | Venus |
| Faction | Autonomist, Skyward Collective |

Chateau Montgolfier is a settlement on Venus consisting of three zeppelins and a handfull of smaller structures (some little more than survival bubbles) that have all been lashed to a large, light-weight mesh.
The three zeppelins are laid out in an "inverted triangle" formation, with two at the port and starboard of the leading edge and one at the back, in an attempt to keep the mesh (relatively) free of prop backwash.
(The down-side is that the leading zeppelins must maneuver carefully to ensure tension on the front of the mesh, as it will otherwise begin to "flap" dangerously.)

The current carrying capacity of the "chateau" is limited, both in terms of occupants and lifting capacity; it is believed that the collective intends it as much as the starting-point for some other construction project as a permanent habitat in itself ‚Äî however, given the Collective's drive to house the unhoused, the chateau is filled to capacity, and likely to remain so.
(The Chateau is occupied by about 360 people, possibly with further occupants as infomorphs.)

Notably, the Chateau's maneuverability is limited, as the non-rigid mesh becomes dangerously unstable at even fairly low airspeeds; to a great degree, they are at the mercy of the winds.
They use their limited mobility to hold near the equator, far away from the planet's polar vortices, and to avoid dangerous weather formations, traffic lanes, and other aerostats as best they can.

### Armoise

| Armoise | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Beehive |
| Gravity | Microgravity; 0.2G (centrigrav track), 0.3G (centrigrav track) |
| Population | 9K |
| Languages | French, English, Skyward Barsoomian, Chinese, Russian |
| Location | Main Belt |
| Faction | Autonomist, Skyward Collective |

Armoise is a beehave habitat located inside a roughly-spherical S-type asteroid about 11km in diameter.
The asteroid was claimed by an Extropian microcorp and mined extensively between BF 19 and 11; after the asteroid was stripped of most metals, it was abandoned.
Over the next fifteen years, it saw occasional visits from scavengers and squatters, who removed anything of value that had been left behind.

In AF 5, the Collective decided to purchase the asteroid.
The microcorp that had originally claimed the asteroid had broken up after they finished mining it (which is a normal procedure for an Extropian microcorp).
The Collective contacted several of the principles, who where willing to sell their interest in the rock for a pittance of @-rep and credits, since they had neither the desire not capability to make any use of it.

While almost all of the equipment had since been either stolen or scrapped for feed-stock, the physical hulls of the beehive hab-modules where intact ‚Äî for the most part, anyway.
A team was dispatched from √âgalit√© with nanofabbing gear and construction mechs; sixteen months later, basic power and life-support had been established, and enough of the caverns and tunnels had been refurbished to provide living space for more than a thousand people.

Over the last four years, the work has continued.
All of the original modules have since been either restored or scrapped for feed-stock, with new construction occuring in mining tunnels and caverns.

The asteroid is generally metal-poor, as only a few trace deposits where left behind by the miners; fortunately, the residents of √âgalit√© are used to operating without easy access to metals, and have brought with them many techniques perfected in the outer system.

The asteroid's present population is approximately nine thousand, drawn from the Extropian belt, Mars, and Jupiter.
If other, similar beehive habs are any guide, the habitat's ultimate carrying capacity might be in the area of ninety thousand people.

### Greed and Envy

| Greed | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Beehive |
| Gravity | Microgravity |
| Population | 4K |
| Languages | Barsoomian (Skyward), French (Quebecois) |
| Location | Main Belt |
| Faction | Autonomist, Skyward Collective |

| Envy | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Stone Torus |
| Gravity | 0.65G (centrigrav) |
| Population | 10K (3K permanent, 7K rotating) |
| Languages | Barsoomian (Skyward), French (Quebecois) |
| Location | Main Belt |
| Faction | Autonomist, Skyward Collective |

Greed and Envy are a pair of habs in the main belt; they share a lazy binary orbit about a thousand kilometers in diameter.
In terms of orbit, at least, Greed is the primary; the solid silicate asteroid is slightly more than four kilometers in diameter.
Envy, meanwhile, is less massive; the torus hab was constructed from a loose rubble-pile roughly 800m in diameter, consisting of organics, volatiles, and silicates ‚Äì suspected to be the result of two smaller rubble-pile asteroids, one C-type and one S-type, being captured by Greed and merging.

The area was initially claimed and occupied by an Extropian mining microcorp in BF23.
They did not intend to permanently occupy the pair, nor did they intend to bring in a large population, so they only needed a small habitat.
They used construction technique similar to that used to construct Cole bubbles, albeit on a much smaller scale, specialized to loose rubble-piles like Envy; the result was a roughly barrel-shaped "torus" hab roughly 900m in diameter.
They then proceeded to begin mining Greed, primarily for silicone.

Unfortunately for the Extropians, their cooperative collapsed in BF 19, a victim of both a diclining price for silicone and volatile internal politics.
The pair sat unoccupied until it was occupied by the Skyward Collective in AF 4.
Unusually, the Collective occupied the asteroids before they arranged to legally purchase them; this was in part because the trail of ownership was so tenuous that they could not identify who held the rights.
They finally identified several candidate stakeholders; they convened several Extropian dispute resolution authorities, got a determination that the identified stake-holders were the most likely to hold the rights to the habs, and purchased the pair for a pittance ‚Äì allegedly less than 10,000 credits.

Presently, Greed and Envy are centers of industrial an trade activity ‚Äì at least by the standards of the Skywards Collective.
One member commune, the Forge Cooperative, claims both habs.
Although Greed is still mined, providing the Collective with a useful source of silicone, its primariy value is as a manufacturing site.
Greed hosts several minifacturing bays, and sports a prominant spaceport.
This facility is not used by the Collective directly; instead, it is leased to other Extropian operations in the belt, providing the Collective with an invaluable source of income.
Additionally, Greed also hosts several vaults and secured facilities; these spaces are also leased to other Autonomists.

Envy, meanwhile, servees primarily as a habitat and research outpost; while Greed is accessible to other Autonomists, Envy is used only by the Collective.
Envy hosts some of the Collective's few (publically-known) research projects.

Both Greed and Envy have very low permanent populations.
Instead, workers ‚Äì both volunteers and draftees, depending on the project and need ‚Äì are rotated in to work in the various projects operating on the habs.
The small permanent population consists mainly of a handfull of committed researchers, obsessives, and idiologs who choose to contribute to their projects continuously, as well as a few civilians who prefer a quiet, low-traffic home over the Collective's more crowded habs.

Estevan ‚Äì n√©e Coleman Barrow ‚Äì is thet Collective's major habitat on Mars.

The settlement is located in the remote and sparsely-populated Terra Cimmeria, in the rugged and cratered highlands west of Hellas Planetia.
Estevan began as a mining settlement: the site was claimed by the Cimmeria Mining Conglomerate in BF 34; the first permanent outpost at the site was built in BF33; and the central dome was constructed between BF 29 and 28.
Mining was conducted in the surrounding craters, gullies, and dunes for nineteen years; mining ceased in BF 9, at which point the company abandoned the town.
By the time the Fall came, Coleman Barrow was a ghost town.

After the Fall, the condition of the settlement was unknown; no TITAN activity was known to have happened anywhere near the hab, but it also was not known to be safe or habitable.
As normal for hypercorps and microcorps, the CMC was wound down when their original mission was completed; it existed only on paper, to hold the conglomerate's remaining interests and assets.
The stakeholders had little interest in the hab, and did not expect any other buyer to present themselves; they sold the habitat cheaply, as-was.

As the Skywards Collective has repaired and reoccupied the habitat, they have taken pains to avoid provoking the Planetary Consortium or the Tharsis League ‚Äì or to at least ensure that they are not worth the effort of enforcement.
They have gone as far as licensing the construction and maintenance nanotech that they used, and making a show of participating in the League's ego-ID system.
For that, Estevan is not the servant of two masters; there is no confusion about whether their ultimate allegiance lies with the Skyward Collective or the Tharsis League.

Estevan consists of the original central habitat ‚Äì still referred to as Coleman Barrow ‚Äì as well as several surrounding outbuildings, facilities, and mines.
Physically, the Barrow is wide, circular cavern, capped over with a dome and covered in gravel.
From the surface, the barrow itself looks like little more than a wide, gently-rising gravel mound; it is surrounded by wide fields of solar panels, several large industrial garages, a number of greenhouses and hydroponics bays, and several new terraforming stations.
Inside, however, it is laid out something like a lunar cavern, with verdant greenways snaking between built-up city blocks.
Many of the city blocks are slightly elevated, constructed on raised rock foundations; this lifts them a few meters above the forrest floor, providing a longer view while still keeping the ground-level view below the canopy.
The original worker housing was spartan and dense, and the Skywards Collective have kept it so; large barracks sit between public canteens, pavilions, and maker bays.

The Barrow is old enough that it was designed to be accessible to non-Mars-adapted morphs.
For that reason, the central hab is connected to several nearby mining operations by sealed underground tunnels.
Skyward has turned some of these mines into living space, equipping them using some of the techniques used in beehive and terrarium habitats.
They've made heavy use of nano- and micro-swarms in the construction of the caverns; they have a rounded, smoothed, finished-stone look, with wiring and supporting equipment fabbed into narrow channels cut into the walls.
Under other circumstances, the caverns might be an austere and unwelcoming environment; to combat this, the residents have decorated them with all manner of public art ‚Äì from graffiti to AR vistas to base-reliefs etched into the rock by nanoswarms.
There is little coordination or control of these decorations, which means that they sometimes clash, becoming in places an uncoordinated mass of color and form.

### Secret Hab near √âgalit√©

**\/\/ No External Circulation; \/\/Need-to-Know Only**

So far, we've basically copied the text from the existing knowledge-base and added notes ‚Äî and we're still going to do that ‚Äî but we're inserting some original research here.

We were investigating the possibility of a hidden habitat somewhere, probably near √âgalit√©.
We were keeping a low profile, and that limited what we could do: we dug up some info on a hidden supply chain running into √âgalit√©, passing through circle-A and guanxi hands, but we couldn't look into it without risking exposure.

Among other things, it sounds like they might be running metallic hydrogen into √âgalit√© off-the-books.
√âgalit√©'s out in the Jovian Greeks, so that suggests that they're running OTVs over short distances.

But ‚Äî and here's the need-to-know part ‚Äî I (\@Gunslinger) have contacts in a Firewall cell that does old-school sig-int, and that includes whole-sky IR surveys.
They show warm spots on a few rocks near √âgalit√©, but nothing very high-energy ‚Äî and a secret lab would probably be dumping a lot of heat.
They also haven't seen anything that looks like a met-H drive flare, at least not any secret ones, not any that √âgalit√© didn't report on their open mesh.

Now, their whole-sky surveys take about thirty hours, so there's about that big of a gap between scans of any given location ‚Äî so it's possible they've just missed 'em.
Unlikely, but possible.
They're willing to do a long-term continuous survey of the place, but they've got a long queue of survey requests, and it'd require either Proxy approval or me calling this an "emergency" to get bumped up in the queue, and I don't think we're there yet.

\@Bauble thinks these guys might be fairly competent at spycraft, and they might already be playing the game, and I agree.
We think it's also possible that these might be false leads, meant to lead people off the trail, or maybe even a trap.
Any agent that checks these leads should proceed with caution.

## Status of Operations **\/\/ Ongoing Operations; \/\/ Need-to-Know Only**

First off: threat assessment unsure, possibly high.
The two avenues \@cur√© is worried about are:

1. They might be working with an ASI/Seed AI.
1. They might start an inter-faction war.

Threat for \#2 is low.
The LLA and Consortium don't love that these guys but habitats on "their" planets, but they've been pretty damn deferential about it.
The Movement, the Jovians, or the Consortium are all way more likely to start a shooting war.
Now, *long-term*, if they build up the kinds of numbers they want to have, could that be a problem?
Sure, but that's a long ways off ‚Äì like decades.

On threat 1, opinions are split.
Of the two of us:

- \@Gunslinger\#MONOLITH: Unknown.
  Those large black-budget working-groups are concerning, but that's it ‚Äì concerning.
  We don't nuke every hab that has an off-the-books project.
  More information is needed.
- \@Bauble: High.
  They feel off, creepy as fuck.
  I do not like it when circle-As keep secrets like this.

Here's where our current operations stand.
We've gathered most of the intelligence we can gather, without direct contact, risking exposure, or moving resources.

They've been resistant to probing.
We know they have some off the books projects ‚Äì even besides the no-public-records working-groups that they also have.
And we know physical resources are being diverted.
We suspect that they have some decent tradecraft; exact capabilities and sophistication unknown.
But we also know they have some weaknesses, like poor physical security on some of their old-ass habs.
Or at least it looks like it from the outoside.

Ongoing operations are:

1. **Building rep and balance on the Fox-Market.**
   We want to slow-roll this one; rushing and pushing will just look suspicious, *especially* if we think they might have some super-human expert systems monitoring this thing.
1. **Working the Guan-Xi to see if we can find an off-the-books shipment.**
   This one is also going to take time if you don't want to come off like a cop or get picked up by the people you're tracking.
1. **Trying to find someone who's defected from the Collective.**
   This one is a little easier, but we also expect less from it.
   We know people leave.
   But, as far as we can tell, nobody from the "inner circle" has defected.
   So, we don't expect anyone we find on the outside to have anything particularly valuable, or a way to get us in.

Of those, the Fox-Market is the best bet.
It's going to be slow ‚Äì and expensive, \@cur√© \@conjurer ‚Äì but it gives us our best shot at getting in touch with people on the inside who will be willing and able to help us, and it keeps our risk of exposure low.
Even though it's a trap.

Next steps are up to \@cur√©.
We think there's something to look into here, more work is justified.
It's router's-choice what that looks like.

### Decision

Good work, you two.

Keep working on the Fox-Market, that sounds like our best bet.
\@Conjurer and I will find you an Extropian sentinel to work with.
And some funding.

\@Bauble, \@anarcat's up for a hab infiltration.
Work with him to pick a hab and get a plan going.
