The Skyward Collective is an anarchist-communist cooperative consisting of a number of allied habitats.
They're notable for their particular brand of hedonist collective anarchism, for their efforts at building new habitats and morphs, and for their advocacy for experimentation with safe seed AIs and super-intelligences.

It should be noted early that, because of their preference for ad-hoc organization, different Skyward habs can have very different social structures.
Some habs may have permanent working-groups that others do not; some may have very different lists of allowed nanotechnology; and some even have fundamentally different economic models.

> Isn't that unusual for circle-A groups?

> **Bauble**: Yes, and yes.

## Founding Values

The Skyward Collective was founded by small cooperative of anarchist thinkers, activists, and partisans operating on an autonomist-aligned habitat in the Jovian Greeks.
It espouses a few core values:

- **Collectivist Anarchism**: the Cooperative strongly supports anarchist social models, egalitarian values, and the collective ownership of all capital;
- **Hedonism**: the Cooperative is very pleasure-oriented, rejecting regimes like work in favor of the pursuit of pleasure;
- **Autonomist Expansion**: the founders of the Cooperative where very concerned that the Planetary Consortium was reinstantiating Fall infugees and integrating them into their society at a much higher rate than the members of the Autonomist Alliance, and wished to create a system that could rapidly absorb and indoctrinate both Fall infugees and the inner-system poor;
- **Tehcnological Progressivism**: the founders saw improving technology as a vital tool both for improving their own lot without the need for labor, and for competing with the Planetary Consortium;
- **Precautionism**: in the aftermath of the Fall, however, the founders also saw a compelling need to ensure that new and powerful technologies did not pose a direct risk to society.

They developed a form of hedonistic collective anarchism that emphasized these principles, successfully incorporated their own habitat using the scheme, and began to establish other collectives using the same scheme in other habitats.

## Society

The Cooperative is set up as an alliance of smaller collectivist cooperatives.
Each member cooperative has near-complete autonomy; while they share social networks, each habitat is allowed to govern itself as it sees fit.
The main requirements are to preserve collective ownership of capital and direct-democratic governance.
Only conflicts between habitats are subject to votes of the entire Skyward Collective; the ultimate level of appeal for all "local" matters is a direct-democratic polling of all residents of the habitat concerned.
Of course, this means that the individual habitats can vary quite a bit in culture, norms, and organization.

Each individual habitat establishes collective ownership of all capital — by a fairly expansive definition that allows little room for personal property.
The output of productive capital is equally distributed by the collective itself; neither currency nor markets are used.
Most systems are automated; where intelligent labor is required, volunteers are typically sought, and reward with resource-allocation bumps.
When required, the Cooperative can compel service: broadly, they can set labor requirements, assign tasks by lottery, or "draft" individuals with unique and necessary skills.

>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Himmel, Arsch, und Zwirn!

>
> **Bauble**: Usually it's a task-setting working group, sometimes it's a public vote.
> *Égalité* has a bunch of work-groups responsible for different parts of the hab, for example, and they publish task lists.

Member cooperatives generally opt for low labor requirements over high productive output: they broadly use the same types of automated resource-extraction and minifacturing that other societies use, but they generally don't supplement it with transhuman labor.
Each member of the cooperative is granted a portion of the resources (feed-stock and energy) produced by the collective, public fabber time to produce their needs and wants, and housing on their habitats; their obligations in turn are minimal, besides surrendering all capital and answering any labor requirement.

Each habitat in the cooperative is administered as an ad-hoc direct-democracy.
They use on-line polling of the entire hab population to make major decisions, while members form "working groups" to make smaller decisions and tackle ongoing tasks and problems.
They prefer ad-hoc forms of social-organization and decision-making to fixed institutions and rules, creating working-groups as the need arises, and dissolving them when the issue is resolved. 
In principle, the cooperative attempts to keep the number and duration of working-groups to a minimum; in practice, most habitats establish a certain number of permanent working-groups, with set internal structure, to tackle important concerns like hab-maintenance or civil justice.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Yeah, as far as I've been able to find, they think that kind of "power-collection" is a Bad Thing.

Absent these two mechanisms, there is no formal government or rule-making: individuals are free to conduct their affairs as they see fit.

Owing largely to their low-to-zero labor expectation, the cooperative tends not to be very productive.
For comparison, per-capita resource allocations sit between one-half and one-third of the median resources consumed by a citizen of the Titanian Commonwealth, depending somewhat on the specific habitat and time.

Their culture is social and hedonistic.
Resource allocations afford a comfortable-if-not-luxurious standard of living, and little is required of individual members; this means that individuals have lots of time to pursue their own interests — which often means sex, drugs and parties.

Habitats tend to be heavily-populated — sometimes overpopulated, by the standards of any society except the Scum.
Reserves are often strained; food, water, and life-support are often prioritized, for obvious reasons, but this often means that Skyward habs do without expensive or resource-intensive technologies or frivolous luxuries.
Carbon allotropes, iron, steel and other conventional materials, and organic components are common instead.
Active meta-materials and cutting-edge server-farms are rare; public, shared facilities like dance-halls, theatres, pubs, and parks are common.

> **H0N3**: If luxuries are rare, how are drugs common?
>
> **Bauble**: There are plenty of party drugs that are simple, organic molecules.
> A CM will make you a gallon of meth or GHB as easily at it'll make you a gallon of soup.
>
> And you can always grow weed, coca, and poppies hydroponically.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: It may not be any of the crazy nanodrugs you can find on the Carnival of the Goat, but some good G wisely and responsibly deployed can make a party.

They also tend to have a progressive-precautionist view of technology — they believe in both the long-term capabilities of technology to transform people and society for the better, but also in the need to ensure the safety, beneficial use and equitable distribution of those technologies before they are deployed.
This can lead to provocative and seemingly contradictory positions: the Skyward Collective simultaneously supports research into safe seed intelligences, for example, while also restricting nanofabrication.

### "Economy," Capital, and Fabbing

The Skyward Collective has a fairly strict communist scheme: allowed personal property is very narrowly construed, consisting mostly of clothing, furniture, pieces of art, and personal effects; everything else is owned collectively by the Cooperative.
Notably, this means that almost all of the habitat infrastructure and productive technology is owned and administered by the cooperative: hab hulls, life support and power systems, resource drones, maintenance drones, and auto-manufacturing systems are all owned collectively.
Notably, all nanofabricators are collectively owned; private ownership of nanofabricators is restricted.

Unlike most other Autonomist groups, owing to their socially-conscious and precautionist views, the Skyward Collective restricts and tracks its members use of nanofabrication — they believe that each cooperative has a legitimate interest in preventing members from producing grenades, nano-plagues, weapons of mass destruction, or other dangerous technologies.
Public nanofabricators will only produce blueprints approved and signed by the community (and private ownership of CMs is not allowed).
Libraries of signed blueprints are made available to members, covering a wide variety of food, clothing, furniture, and useful technologies; members can request anything from the library and, subject to their resource limits, it will be manufactured by a nearby public CM and either delivered by a drone or held for pick-up.

On most habitats, a permanent working-group is responsible for vetting and signing blueprints, and for maintaining the public fabrication network.
Like most other work-groups, these groups make as much of their process public as possible — although, for obvious reasons, they typically will not publish blueprints that they reject for signing.
Also like most other work-groups, a vote of the general population can overturn these groups' decisions, although this rarely happens.
(Although it is a point of conflict with many other anarchist groups, precautionist viewpoints are fairly well-entrenched in Skyward habs, and most people support the idea of blocking public fabbers from producing grenades, seeker-launchers, and other destructive devices.)

A few additional blueprints are made available only to *trusted* members, or are reserved for members of specific working-groups; additionally, a small number of potentially-abusable blueprints are restricted from members flagged as being *antisocial*.

The Cooperative also maintains large nanofabbing and conventional minifacturing facilities on several of its habs, the former for the production of large hardware (like habitat systems) and the latter for manufacturing common objects (like clothing, furniture, tableware and tools) more efficiently than on-demand nanofacture.
The collective also makes use of conventional agriculture and hydroponics, both for food (and drug) production and for environmental maintenance.

Their economy has a very low per-capita productivity — another aspect of their "responsible socialist hedonism."
The feelings tends to be, "we have enough for everyone to be comfortable, as long as no-one gets greedy," where there is a particular stigma attached to "being greedy".
Most of their habitats sport sufficient automated resource-gathering and industry to provide their members a comfortable (if not luxurious) standard of living, and most members are satisfied with that, more or less.
Notably, their particular strict-socialist scheme is not set up to encourage members to be much more productive, since any additional resources or capital they produce would be yielded to the Cooperative to be equitably distributed.
(In the minds of the founders of the Skyward Collective, at least, this is a feature rather than a bug; they tend to place a high premium on equitable distribution, and to have a dim view of excess and waste.)

While it may be an academic point, Skywards is technically a command economy, rather than a reputation economy.
While the Collective does administer a social network and keep reputation scores, these do not affect individual members' resource allocations; rather, each member receives an equal base resource payout, potentially with resource bumps earned by volunteering for a task from a work-queue.
Beyond the operations of drones, auto-manufacturies and public fabbing, very little economic activity occurs, and so there is very little economic organization to speak of.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Huh, these guys are kind of old-school.
>
> **Bauble**: Yeah.
> The fab restrictions I'm especially not a fan of.
>
> **anarcat**: You can really start to see the ways that these folks don't quite line up with the rest of the Autonomist Alliance.

### Work-Groups, Trusted Members and the Antisocial

Work-groups are a core feature of the Skyward Collective's social organization.
Work-groups are self-organizing groups of members, formed in order to tackle specific tasks, provide specific services or resolve specific issues.

Most work groups are small and temporary, formed for a particular purpose and dissolved when that purpose is completed; these work-groups are typically informal.
They will operate publicly, they will attempt to secure the involvement of all concerned parties, and their activities will be archived, but they are given no actual authority; it is considered poor form to ignore or subvert a work-group that is managing a certain task, but there is no actual penalty for doing so.

Some work-groups, however, are permanent, and are granted a measure of authority.
Typically, this is done by proposing a charter, which will include a short description of the purpose of the group and its initial operating rules; these charters are then put up to a vote by the whole community, and (typically) must pass with a two-thirds majority.
(Once established, charters can also be modified or recalled by the community, although this often requires a two-thirds majority to achieve.)

There is no particular template for a permanent working-group; they can have very different sizes, authorities, and rules, depending on the tasks they are attempting to accomplish.
Most are allowed fairly wide latitude in their internal arrangement, forming their own rules of order and operating procedures; they are typically expected to make as much of their proceedings public as possible, although some — like most Justice working-groups — keep large portions of their operations secret; and they typically cannot make major decisions for the hab on their own, instead publishing advisory documents or putting final proposals up for votes.

> **Bauble**: A common scheme we saw was creating a "planning group" and then requiring that their proposal get an up-or-down vote before letting people tinker.
> The idea is to try to let experts get first-crack at policy while still being a direct democracy.

Some working-groups also have access to specialized hardware or blueprints that the general populace may not be allowed; for example, Defense working-groups may have access to military weaponry that the general populace does not.
Some working-groups may also have special authority granted to them or their members; Civil Peace and Justice working-groups, for example, have the power to act as a peace-force and judicial system, respectively, and they can grant the authority to their members to act as peace officers, social workers, public prosecutors, or public defenders.
Many working-groups have internal training and qualification systems; Civil Peace, Civil Justice, Engineering, and Education working-groups all typically train and qualify their members.
(The structure of Education working-groups is interesting: they spend more time on certifying teachers and developing materials than on direct education.
Learning is often at the learner's discretion, and "off-line.")

Of course, working-groups are as dependent on volunteers as the rest of the collective, and so the amount of training and professional work they can do is limited; still, the permanent working-groups represent a reserve of expertise that many other outer-system autonomist societies fail to establish at all.

Beyond the working-groups, the community can also designate some members as *trusted members*.
As the name implies, *trusted members* have earned the trust of the community; this carries no direct privilege, but it makes them eligible for certain positions of trust that other members do not qualify for.
Some restricted technologies are only available to trusted members; protean swarms, for example, are usually only available to trusted members, and dissassemblers are only available to trusted members in certain work-groups.

Conversely, some members are designated as *antisocial*; this is often done as a temporary measure in response to minor crime, or sometimes in response to consistent, minor antisocial behavior.
Antisocial members *loose* access to some technologies or blueprints, and may suffer other minor disciplinary actions as well.
(Of course, labelling a member as antisocial is not the extent of the Skyward justice system; their Civil Peace and Justice working-groups have access to many of the tools and remedies that other justice-systems do.)

### Expansion

Unlike some autonomist collectives, Skyward Collective aims to expand their reach and grow their numbers, with the specific aim of providing a counter-weight to the inner-system capitalist governments.
The collective's founders where concerned by the much greater rate at which the capitalist economies of the inner-system where resleeving and integrating infugees: many outer-system polities, with slower and less-productive economies and lower incentive for growth, only slowly selected and reinstantiated infugee egos, while Mars in particular was capable of sustaining a much larger population, and the hypercapitalist economy was capable of producing morphs at a much greater rate, and matching them with infugee egos and indentures.
A major goal for the Skyward Collective was to create a collectivist-anarchist model that could be implemented throughout the system, and that could rapidly resleeve and integrate infugees, providing the Autonomist Alliance with desperately needed numbers.

The Skyward Collective are generally nonviolent; in order to expand, they aim to acquire old or abandoned habitats through legitimate means and establish peer collectives in them.
By working within local legal systems where possible, they sometimes attempt to establish peer member collectives "behind enemy lines," within the inner system; for example, they have purchased a small surface hab on Luna, have occupied an abandoned mining outpost in the inner belt, and have built an improvised "aerostat" on Venus by attaching three large zeppelins and a dozen smaller envelopes to a large mesh on Venus.

So far, despite their goals, their numbers remain relatively small; the entire collective numbers slightly more than 120,000 people (as nearly as can be determined).

### Technology, Research, and Safe Seed AI

The Skywards Cooperative also maintains a number of working-groups running research projects.
(And somewhat at odds with the society's resource-spare hedonistic norms, some of these working-groups are relatively well resourced.)

The Cooperative engages in research in automation and ALI development, the better to operate their society in the near-absence of human labor; and in adapting active, growing, nano-tissue construction materials for general use.

Very unusually, they are advocates for the development of safe super-intelligence and seed intelligence; they believe that the development of these technologies is inevitable, that their potential is enormous — even fundamentally transformative, for society and individuals — and that it can be done safely.
So far, all of their work is in advocacy and theory — they have so far been unwilling to resume experimenting with the technologies that caused the Fall.

Notably, some of their working-groups appear to enjoy both greater access to resources and greater secrecy for their efforts — although this is difficult to assess.

## Habitats

### Égalité

Égalité is the founding hab for the Skyward Collective, and still its single largest member.

Early on, both the founding cooperative and the entire collective movement had the same name, "*Humble Beginnings*."
During the second year, it was decided allowing the founding hab to share the same name as the whole collective violated the spirit of communist equality; the hab was renamed *Égalité*.
(Four months after that, it was decided that a slightly more stirring — and more wieldy — name was required for the collective, and it was renamed *Skyward*.)

The hab was originally built by a pre-fall hypercorp in the Jovian Greeks to support mining operations.
The 540m-radius torus was not an ideal design for so far from the sun, and it was abandoned by its original hypercorp owner in BF 6.
The station's next occupants arrived barely three years later, aided by contacts in the former hypercorp owner's administration; importantly, this group had formed around a core of anarchist-communist theorists and activists.

Infugee influx during the fall dramatically expanded their population; during and after the Fall, integrating and indoctrinating the new arrivals was a primary concern.
The stations activist founders watched on with concern as the Hypercorp Consortium set about combing through stored infugee egos, sleeving them, and integrating them; concern for the Hypercorp Consortium's growing population led the occupants to launch an initiative to similarly grow the Autonomists' ranks with infugees, and this the Skyward Collective was born.

Égalité remains the largest and most populous of the Skyward Collective's habs.
Égalité is a torus hab with a radius of 544m, a rim-width of 89m, and a rim-height of 73m; it's spun to three-quarters of G, and a human-baseline environment is maintained inside — that is, one atmosphere of pressure, a 24-hour day/night cycle, a temperature between 14C and 27C, and a year-long seasonal cycle.
It currently has a population of 65,000.

> **anarcat**: Just to save you some headache, that's about 1.1 rpm, and a tangential velocity of 63m/s at the rim.
>
> **Bauble**: That population's also on the high-side for a torus that size.

Égalité also retains some of the heavy infrastructure from its former life as a mining outpost; this gives it an ability to mine local asteroids and to produce some larger pieces of equipment.
