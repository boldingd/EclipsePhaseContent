# the Huygens Metro Area

> The *Huygens Metro Area* is a small region located in the northern equatorial region of Mars.
> It includes outposts from a number of factions: an Argonaut facility, two Hypercorp-owned cities, and a Mutualist settlement.
>
> I originally created it as a setting for a *Guard Co-Op* campaign I ran for my group; it was a place where a planet-bound team could still encounter a major Cognite holding.
> And, like many of the settings I come up with, it includes outposts and holdings from several factions, which makes for complex local politics, and also makes it a little easier for teams from diverse backgrounds to operate.

The Huygens Metro Area is a region located on the slope between the Syrtis Major Planum (a shield volcano) and Isidis Planitia (and impact basin), just north of the equator; it contains four major settlements, with a total population around 280 thousand people.

## History

The earliest settlement in the area was The Ditch, which was constructed in BF 36; it's old enough that it was associated with an old-Earth national government, the United States, and was originally called the "Syrtis Major Site".
The installation became effectively independent when the US lost the ability to meaningfully operate on Mars in the years preceding the Fall; the Ditch was then briefly claimed by Hypercorporate interests, but left with the Argonauts when they separated from the Consortium, and has been in Argonaut hands ever since.

The region is not near any of the major domed cities, and for decades the Ditch was the only major settlement in the area.
That changed in BF 4 when Cognite decided to build an installation on the surface of Mars, and selected the open region to the northeast of the Ditch as the site; construction of Endicott City began before the end of the year.
The Polygons followed in BF 1, and Gravel was constructed in AF 7.

As the population in the area has grown — and the area's politics have become more complicated — the area's civil government has grown more prominent.
The Ditch and Endicott had formed a resource-sharing agreement in BF2, and included the Polygon Cooperative in BF 1; this agreement proved to be vital during the Fall, when it was necessary both to sustain the Polygons and defend the area.
With the rise of the Tharsis League, this agreement was expanded into the Huygens Metropolitan Area Authority.
The HMAA serves as the region's independent civil government, representing the settlements in the Tharsis League, managing local resources sharing, providing for policing, and operating the small spaceport spaceport currently under construction to the southeast.

It was the Argonauts that named the region in BF 28; it was named not for Huygens Crater, which sits hundreds of kilometers to the southwest, but indirectly for Isidis Planitia, which was the first surface feature recorded on Mars by Christiaan Huygens.

The Ditch is an old Argonaut facility with a nearly 50-year history.
Constructed relatively early in the colonization of Mars, it took advantage of existing terrain features and used local materials; it's built along a gully, which was walled off, roofed over, and sealed with ceramics and concrete made from the local rock.
Structures and burrows where then dug out of the walls of the cavern.
Over the years, the facilities of the Ditch have improved substantially – it's modern facilities could even be described as cutting-edge – although its layout remains somewhat haphazard, as it's often expanded as the need arose, resources become available, and project leaders stepped forward.

Today, on the surface, the Ditch can be identified by the dull-grey, slightly dog-legged strip of concrete panels that form its roof, running level just below the ragged lip of the gully.
This is surrounded by a disorganized assortment of out-buildings, heat-sinks, solar panels, communications masts, and radiators.
Surrounding this is an expanse of fields, greenhouses, algae ponds, and wild plant life.

The gully that the Ditch occupies runs roughly north to south, and is slightly dog-legged; it is also slightly wider at the base, narrowing towards the top.
Little natural bare rock remains; the walls of the Ditch where finished a decade before the Fall, and more recently, engineer nanoswamrs have been used to elaborately sculpt reliefs and statues into the martian rock and concrete.

Though far from the Argonaut's largest outpost on Mars, it is a substantial facility.
While it is heavily involved in terraforming, nano-ecology, and genetic engineering – hence the fields and greenhouses on the surface – it also has smaller facilities related to other fields.
The Ditch also conducts research into both solar power (investigating the use of organic construction and nanotechnology to produce cheap, self-growing panels) and cognitive science (which has grown significantly since the founding of Endicott).
The Ditch also has substantial server facilities and a sizable surface communications tower, which makes it a convenient destination for Argonauts wishing to travel to Mars without entering a major city.

The Ditch has a population of more than seven thousand, consisting not only of Argonaut scientists, but also support personnel, families, and even Fall refugees; this in turn means that the Ditch has not only research labs and support facilities, but also minifacturies, businesses, police, and even a school.
This has required the Ditch to develop a civil administration, somewhat to the Argonauts' chagrin.
The Ditch is governed by a democratically-elected Civil Council and independently-elected Civil Executive; beneath the Civil Executive are an elected Administrator and a Chief Scientist selected by division leads and principle investigators, typically by seniority.

Although they are substantial, the Ditch's large (and experimental) solar fields do not produce enough energy to power the city; instead, it relies primarily on a fusion power plant.
This means that the Ditch can be a significant *exporter* of power to the local HMAA exchange.
On the other hand, the Ditch does not have a body-bank or resleeving facilities, beyond those in its local medical facilities; therefore, visitors egocasting in to the city will need to acquire a body from somewhere else (or be content with running as an infomorph hosted in the Ditch's substantial servers).

## Endicott City

| Endicott City | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Building Complex |
| Gravity | Mars gravity (0.38G) |
| Population | 175k |
| Languages | English, Mandarin |
| Location | Mars, Syrtis Major Planum |

Endicott is a large Martian habitat owned (primarily) by Cognite.
Cognite's motivation in constructing a planet-side installation are somewhat unclear.
The benign motivation that Cognite has put forward is that many of their employees and contractors where unwilling to relocate to Phobos, preferring to live on Mars; by most accounts, it's likely that internal corporate politics where also involved.
Being located near the Ditch – and thus having ready access to Argonaut-aligned facilities and talent – very likely also played a role.

In true hypercorporate fashion, Cognite does not directly own and administer Endicott City; instead, they established a conglomerate holding company, the Endicott City Holding Company, to construct and administer the habitat.
While this holding company does directly own and administer some pieces of city infrastructure (and, of course, the city itself), it contracts out many city services to a host of other hypercorps.

Naturally, Cognite holds a 55% stake in the ECHC, ensuring that their interests are ultimately served.
Usually contributing to their controlling interest, one Jeong Sujo, a prominent figure in the upper ranks of the local Cognite workforce and something of a local oligarch, holds a 6% stake in the ECHC as an individual.
Counterbalancing this slightly are the Endicott Workers' Association, which holds an 11% stake, and the Polygon Cooperative, which holds a 9% stake.
The remainder of the of the shares are distributed between several local companies (notably including a few corporate parks and large rental properties); a few local-wealthy with 1% or 2% shares; and a few institutional investors with no other direct involvement in the city.

Unlike the larger domed cities of Mars, Endicott City is a "solid" construction, more like a traditional building from Earth.
Living and working spaces are built in the "walls" and "towers" of the habitat, which run from floor to ceiling; the open, public spaces of the habitat are a "negative" space inside it.
The city is a slightly irregular, hour-glass shape, layed out from southwest (toward Syrtis Major Planum) to northeast (towards Isidis Planitia), and is roughly 750m from southwest to northeast.
The city is a little more than 65m high, typically leaving room for around 18 or 19 usable stories on the interior (excluding supporting equipment, such as life-support).

The habitat does have three multifaceted, gemstone-like domes, complete with forested natural landscapes, although these are smaller constructions sitting on the roof of the hab: two each are on the large "lobes" of the hourglass, one looking southwest towards Syrtis Major Planum and the other looking northeast towards Isidis Planitia, and one in the center.
A narrow "slice" has been cut out of the solar fields surrounding the city, to allow a (relatively) unobstructed view.

Much of the exterior of the habitat is made of a solid, composite, concrete-like material constructed primarily of local martian rock; this outer layer is extremely thick, to provide ample protection from cosmic rays.
(Stricly speaking, the thinner material that the domes are made of would provide inadequate protection for morphs without the appropriate biomods; morphs without basic biomods are advised to limite time spent in the domes.)
The roof of the hab is accessible to residents, and is laid out much like an open, spare park; it also has landing-points for flying cars and helos.

The city is also surrounded by an extensive field of solar panels – the largest of any of the habitats in the area.
This is augmented with internal fusion power sources, and substantial power storage.
Unsurprisingly, Endicott City is a major exporter of power – much of which purchased by Gravel to the north.

The city has a population of roughly two-hundred and forty thousand.
Of this, only about thirty thousand are either Cognite employees or their direct dependants, with another fifty thousand working for subsidiaries and contractors.
The remaining population work in supporting industries, service industries, unrelated fields (including a number of terraformers), and even for competing firms who wish to draw from the same pool of talent.

Notably, Endicott also has the largest public communication spar, and the largest body bank in the region by far; for this reason, most visitors egocasting into the area arrive in Endicott City.
(The Ditch also has substantial communication infrastructure, but it is reserved primarily for Argonaut use.)

### Cognite

Of course, Cognite has substantial facilities in Endicott, carrying out research in several different areas.
Among the more positive areas of research are several projects investigating psychosurgical therapies, and a Cognite-affiliated micro-university program for conventional therapy.

Of course, not all activity at Endicott is publicly reported or benign; rumors run from netwar ALIs up to alleged efforts to find "adversarial inputs" that can attack human egos – research that might ultimately unlock capabilities much like those attributed to TITAN "incapacitating inputs."
Both journalists and so-called open-source intelligence groups have been attempting to gather reliable information about Cognites more secretive activities, so far with little success.

> **Plasmage**: Here, obviously, is where our interest begins.
> Nobody really believes they're trying to work their way up to basilisk hacks from first principles, not when the TITANs gave us working examples.
> And if they're trying to reverse-engineer basilisk hacks, then they're going to have a captured population they can test on in Endicott – one where they can have containment if things go wrong, without putting their facilities on Phobos at risk.
>
> Now we have no solid evidence that that's the case, either – and yes, some people have pointed out that it's cartoonishly evil even for Cognite to experiment on their own population, not to mention incredibly stupid to put their own facilities at risk – but we'd still really like to rule it out *definitively*.

> No.

> I'll talk to my router.

### The Endicott Workers' Association

The Endicott Workers' Association is an umbrella organization that exists to defend the interests of Endicott City's working classes.
Technically, like the ECHC itself, the EWA is a holding company; it exists to hold and administer assets on behalf of its stakeholders.
In practice, it serves a purpose something between a mutual fund, retirement fund, union, and political party.
While not a union itself, each of Endicott's four unions holds a 7% stake apiece in the EWA; while not a political party, it uses its 11% stake in the ECHC to represent workers' (and the unions') interests in ECHC decision-making; and, while not a social service, it uses the interests collected from the assets it owns (also including the interest collected from their 11% stake in the city itself) to fund supplemental incomes and services for its members.

## the Polygon Steps

| The Polygon Steps | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Module, Building Complex |
| Gravity | Mars gravity (0.38G) |
| Population | 13k |
| Languages | English, Spanish, Arabic |
| Location | Mars, Syrtis Major Planum |

More commonly and simply called the Hexagons, the Polygon Steps are an Extropian market-socialist habitat located about a kilometer and a half northwest of Endicott City.
The habitat is owned by the Polygon Cooperative, a market-socialist Extropian cooperative.

The habitat is designed as a closely-clustered set of hexagonal "towers" of various heights, giving it a look a bit like an abstract art installation – although the design is functional as well as cosmetic.
Construction on the habitat began in BF 1, and continued into the Fall; the design of the Polygons allows them to be constructed cheaply and quickly; to be broken into individual units, each capable of being built, expanded, or modified separately; to be equipped with redundant systems; and to be capable of being isolated from the others.

Each tower has the same "footprint", so that they will fit together or tesselate: each is a hexagon 50m to a side.
The tallest tower, situated in the middle of the Polygons, is 65m high; the others around it are shorter, *generally* decreasing in height as you move away from the center.
The exterior walls of each tower are heavily constructed, being about 4m thick; they consist of outer retaining walls made of iron extracted from local rock, with the interior filled with crushed rock.
Similarly, the roof of each tower is covered with a thick layer of crushed rock almost five meters thick, contained by an outer retaining wall; this provides ample cosmic radiation shielding.
(A roof that heavy is made significantly more practical in Mars' low gravity.)
The upper surface of the roofs are typically covered in a fine layer of dust and grit, and are often styled as rock gardens – most as so-called "Zen" gardens, although a few feature other decorations.
Two towers feature some larger boulders topped planted with lichen, one features watered planters with saplings of hardy mars-adapted ceders, and one, has a small statuary garden.
(And a few, of course, are equipped with operating facilities, such as communications towers or landing spaces for flying cars.)
The area is often described as sparsely beautiful.

The interior of the habitat is the kind of close-quarters chaos that typifies the main belt, an environment in which maybe only Extropians thrive.

Each hexagonal tower is only connected to its neighbors at specific access points, which sport heavy bulkhead doors; these doors are built to be wide enough to allow the free movement of large numbers of people when open, often ten meters across and running from floor to ceiling.
These bulkhead doors typically lead into large, central public spaces, like major thoroughfares or small public atriums.
At a few points, the public spaces on either side of a bulkhead door have roughly merged, leading to what is functionally one large, irregular concourse with a narrow point in the middle, spanning two levels of two different towers; at other points, bulkhead doors lead to central access-ways that quickly narrow down to alleyways or end in cul-de-sacks.

Outside of these central points, the interior of each level is often a maze of store-fronts, offices, and homes, packed together with little planning, separated by narrow and zig-zagging hallways and alleys.
Each block of floor space – each home, shop, facility, or office – is often laid out and decorated according to the needs and tastes of its owners, with little concern for how it integrates with anything else; this can lead to a riot of strange neighbors and competing styles, set in a maze that is impossible to navigate without AR assistance.
High-end Korean/Cajun fusion restaurants sit across from walk-up body-mod shops; raucous parties roasting street food in ovens made of cinder-blocks sit opposite relic-shops dealing in physical old-earth books; and up-and-coming galleries sit at the back of twisting, narrow corridors, tucked against the outer bulkhead walls.

Unlike the other habitats in the region, the Polygon Steps don't specialize in any particular industry; true to the Extropian reputation, a little of everything can be found in the vibrant and dynamic markets of the Hexagons.
Notably, they do possess several minifacturing bays and industrial-scale fabbers; this makes them a surprisingly productive industrial economy, despite their small population.
Of course, the Hexagons also boast a thriving service sector, in cluding a range of services that are otherwise illegal in Consortium habitats.
They often sometimes serve as a refuge for those who wish to operate from a safe or neutral position while they deal with Cognite or Somatek.

### Market Socialism

The Polygon Cooperative falls into a broad spectrum of market-socialist and social-anarchist systems.
They reject the accumulation of capital possible under hypercapitalsim, and the concentration of coercive power possible in statist systems; however, unlike more classically socialist systems, they do not attempt to completely extinguish private property, and they reject the labor theory of value.

The habitat does not *in general* reject private property, nor does it attempt to distinguish between use-right and capitalist ownership.
It does, however, reject the private ownership or exclusive exploitation of natural resources, the seeking of rent, and the private ownership of the major infrastructure required for the survival of individuals and the function of the community – i.e. the habitat itself and its major infrastructure.

Similarly, the habitat does not accept the labor theory of value; they allow both freely-priced exchange and wage labor.
Like many mutualist systems, while they do not directly inveigh into member's private affairs, they do provide both a public dividend and cheap support for new cooperatives, under the assumption that these will prevent exploitative relationships from developing.

In practice, the habitat itself, its infrastructure and major facilities, and its supporting drone fleets are "owned" by the Polygon Coopeprative.
(They claim the "ownership" of the habitat only so far as it is required by the Tharsis League's laws.)
Some of the output of these systems are auctioned to members and member-cooperatives for productive use; the remaining resources are distributed to members for their use.

The Cooperative itself is member-held and uses a direct-democratic model of governance.
In practice, the top-level Cooperative does little.
Members contract for most services on the habitat's market; as in most Extropian or market-anarchist systems, this even includes conflict-resolution, self-defence, healthcare, and education.
The Cooperative's main operations are to maintain the habitat, its major facilities, and its drones; to oversee the various cooperatives and private providers of services; and to manage the habitat's defences.

Trading material resources outside of the markete-socialist community requries a special dispensation; the community claims a portion of the price of such sales.
(One of the few instances of a tax or levy in their society.)
This is not the case for *services*, however; and the Cooperative has a thriving (if eclective) service economy.

## Gravel

| Gravel | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Burried Dome |
| Gravity | Mars gravity (0.38G) |
| Population | 51k |
| Languages | English |
| Location | Mars, Syrtis Major Planum |
| Faction | Planetary Consortium, Tharsis League |
| Owner | Gravel Development Company, Soma-Tek (indirect), Gravel Non-Human Advocacy Group (indirect) |
| Governance | Private Ownership with Advisory Votes |
| Economy | Transitional, Hypercapitalist |
| Industry | Research, Uplifting, Uplift Accomodations |

Gravel is the newest habitat in the region.
It was rapidly constructed in AF 7, as a shameless attempt by Soma-Tek to buy a chunk of what was developing into a prosperous economic region and a useful pool of talent.

Even more than Cognite, Soma-Tek was not interested in owning or administering a habitat.
They also established a holding-company to develop and administer their habitat, and were not discriminating in who they partnered with.
Today, Soma-Tek has only a 26% share in the Gravel Development Company – still the largest single owner, and more than enough to ensure that their interests are served, but not enough to control the habitat outright.
They are joined by the *Gravel Non-Human Advocacy Association*, which represents the interests of uplifts in Gravel, at 15%; the *Gravel Association of Microfacturers*, an industrial trade group, at 13%; the Soma-Tek Employee Investment Fund at 11%;Tharsis Capital and Freehold Investing, two hypercapitalist mutual funds, at 9% and 6%, respectively; and a host of smaller investors and partners.
This leads, unsurprisingly, to both chaotic and nonpartisan management of the habitat.

They also have not been discriminating in who the GDC leases space too, nor has the GDC itself exerted a particularly heavy (or coordinated) hand in civil planning.
As a result, Gravel is commonly held to be *chaotic* in its internal design and layout.
The habitat is a riot of designs and styles, with streets meeting at odd angles, irregularly-sized parks and terraces inserted into whatever spaces are available, and gleaming neowestern office tours sitting next to neo-Avian towers.

Being founded by Soma-Tek, the habitat offers uplifts (and AGIs) equal legal status to transhumans; this is an improvement over the Tharsis League's laws, which treats AGIs and uplifts as second-class citizens, subject to legal restriction and requirements that transhumans are not.
As such, Gravel has attracted a number of Mars' AGIs and uplifts.
This has not helped the chaos of Gravel's internal design, with many buildings and public spaces designed to cater to different uplift species, from neo-cetaceans to neo-avians.

Gravel's economy is more diverse than Endicott City's; as a result, it is growing faster.
Soma-Tek's influence has also been much less heavy-handed; they are willing to allow the city to grow and change in ways that do not directly serve their interests – so long as they also do not injure them, of course.
While the city is still well below it's designed population, it may reach it within another year; the city's growth is fast enough that the GDC has begun consideration of possible expansion.
Some joke that, in ten years time, Gravel may turn out to be the region's largest and most prosperous habitat.

While Gravel does have it's own solar fields and fusion power plants, it is a net-importer of both power and water.
This wrankles some, who feel that the simple and communitarian design of the HMAA will be spoiled if permanent producer/consumer relations are established.
At the same time, the population of Gravel has been useful in checking the interests of Cognite in local politics – if not those of the much larger Endicott city.

### Crime

Gravel has also attracted a criminal element.

## Huygens Metropolitan Area Authority

The Huygens Metropolitan Area Authority (HMAA) is the civil government of the region.
It grew out of pre-existing resource-sharing arrangements, first between the Ditch and Endicott City, and later incorporating the Polygon Cooperative.
The HMAA as such was established to represent the region and its inhabitants in the Tharsis League.

The HMAA is a federation of the area's settlements, empowered to handle only certain tasks, with the settlements themselves remaining otherwise sovereign.
The HMAA represents the population in the Tharsis League; operates the Hyugens Resource Exchange; maintains a local police force; supports the Rangers assigned to the region; and operates the region's small primary spaceport.

Importantly, this is also how the settlements of the region have gotten away with bending – and sometimes breaking – the League's rules.
It is the HMAA that is a member of the Tharsis League, and thus it is the HMAA that is responsible for enforcing the League's laws and regulations.
However, in practice, the Association is controlled by and responsible to its member habitats and their populations.
Therefore, whenever a conflict between the mandates of the League and the desires of the residents of the Syrtis Major Planum arise, it is the latter that tend to win out.

The HMAA is also a representative democracy – votes are accorded to *residents*, not the settlements themselves.
This means that large local interests like Cognite and Soma-Tek cannot completely dominated the HMAA; whle they do not want for either political influence or control within their habs, they cannot control (or at least have not yet controlled) the votes of the residents of Endicott or Gravel directly.
This, together with a large amount of political capital expended by the Ditch and the Polygon Cooperative, has ensured that the HMAA relatively "secular" – far more concerned with local politics, policing, and administration than it is with shutting down insufficiently-licensed Extropian fabs or ensuring that AGIs are locked-down to the letter of the League's law.

### Facilities

The HMAA has two major physical outposts in the area: the Area Seat in the southwest, and the Hyugens Spaceport in the southeast.

The Area Seat is a small outpost that hosts the federal government's few facilities.
It's dominated
