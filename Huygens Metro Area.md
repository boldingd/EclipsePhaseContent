# the Huygens Metro Area

> The *Huygens Metro Area* is a small region located in the northern equatorial region of Mars.
> It includes outposts from a number of factions: an Argonaut facility, two Hypercorp-owned cities, and a Mutualist settlement.
>
> I originally created it as a setting for a *Guard Co-Op* campaign I ran for my group; it was a place where a planet-bound team could still encounter a major Cognite holding.
> And, like many of the settings I come up with, it includes outposts and holdings from several factions, which makes for complex local politics, and also makes it a little easier for teams from diverse backgrounds to operate.

The Huygens Metro Area is a region located on the slope between the Syrtis Major Planum (a shield volcano) and Isidis Planitia (and impact basin), just north of the equator; it contains four major settlements, with a total population around 280 thousand people.

## History

The earliest settlement in the area was The Ditch, which was constructed in BF 36; it's old enough that it was associated with an old-Earth national government, the United States, and was originally called the "Syrtis Major Site".
The installation became effectively independent when the US lost the ability to meaningfully operate on Mars in the years preceding the Fall; the Ditch was then briefly claimed by Hypercorporate interests, but left with the Argonauts when they separated from the Consortium, and has been in Argonaut hands ever since.

The region is not near any of the major domed cities, and for decades the Ditch was the only major settlement in the area.
That changed in BF 4 when Cognite decided to build an installation on the surface of Mars, and selected the open region to the northeast of the Ditch as the site; construction of Endicott City began before the end of the year.
The Polygons followed in BF 1, and Gravel was constructed in AF 7.

As the population in the area has grown — and the area's politics have become more complicated — the area's civil government has grown more prominent.
The Ditch and Endicott had formed a resource-sharing agreement in BF2, and included the Polygon Cooperative in BF 1; this agreement proved to be vital during the Fall, when it was necessary both to sustain the Polygons and defend the area.
With the rise of the Tharsis League, this agreement was expanded into the Huygens Metropolitan Area Authority.
The HMAA serves as the region's independent civil government, representing the settlements in the Tharsis League, managing local resources sharing, providing for policing, and operating the small spaceport spaceport currently under construction to the southeast.

It was the Argonauts that named the region in BF 28; it was named not for Huygens Crater, which sits hundreds of kilometers to the southwest, but indirectly for Isidis Planitia, which was the first surface feature recorded on Mars by Christiaan Huygens.

## The Ditch

The Ditch is an old Argonaut facility with a nearly 50-year history.
Constructed relatively early in the colonization of Mars, it took advantage of existing terrain features and used local materials; it's built along a gully, which was walled off, roofed over, and sealed with ceramics and concrete made from the local rock.
Structures and burrows where then dug out of the walls of the cavern.
Over the years, the facilities of the Ditch have improved substantially – it's modern facilities could even be described as cutting-edge – although its layout remains somewhat haphazard, as it's often expanded as the need arose, resources become available, and project leaders stepped forward.

Today, on the surface, the Ditch can be identified by the dull-grey, slightly dog-legged strip of concrete panels that form its roof, running level just below the ragged lip of the gully.
This is surrounded by a disorganized assortment of out-buildings, heat-sinks, solar panels, communications masts, and radiators.
Surrounding this is an expanse of fields, greenhouses, algae ponds, and wild plant life.

The gully that the Ditch occupies runs roughly north to south, and is slightly dog-legged; it is also slightly wider at the base, narrowing towards the top.
Little natural bare rock remains; the walls of the Ditch where finished a decade before the Fall, and more recently, engineer nanoswamrs have been used to elaborately sculpt reliefs and statues into the martian rock and concrete.

Though far from the Argonaut's largest outpost on Mars, it is a substantial facility.
While it is heavily involved in terraforming, nano-ecology, and genetic engineering – hence the fields and greenhouses on the surface – it also has smaller facilities related to other fields.
The Ditch also conducts research into both solar power (investigating the use of organic construction and nanotechnology to produce cheap, self-growing panels) and cognitive science (which has grown significantly since the founding of Endicott).
The Ditch also has substantial server facilities and a sizable surface communications tower, which makes it a convenient destination for Argonauts wishing to travel to Mars without entering a major city.

The Ditch has a population of more than seven thousand, consisting not only of Argonaut scientists, but also support personnel, families, and even Fall refugees; this in turn means that the Ditch has not only research labs and support facilities, but also minifacturies, businesses, police, and even a school.
This has required the Ditch to develop a civil administration, somewhat to the Argonauts' chagrin.
The Ditch is governed by a democratically-elected Civil Council and independently-elected Civil Executive; beneath the Civil Executive are an elected Administrator and a Chief Scientist selected by division leads and principle investigators, typically by seniority.

Although they are substantial, the Ditch's large (and experimental) solar fields do not produce enough energy to power the city; instead, it relies primarily on a fusion power plant.
This means that the Ditch can be a significant *exporter* of power to the local HMAA exchange.
On the other hand, the Ditch does not have a body-bank or resleeving facilities, beyond those in its local medical facilities; therefore, visitors egocasting in to the city will need to acquire a body from somewhere else (or be content with running as an infomorph hosted in the Ditch's substantial servers).

## Endicott City

Endicott is a large installation maintained by Cognite on Mars.
