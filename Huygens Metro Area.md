# the Huygens Metro Area

The Huygens Metro Area is a region located on the slope between the Syrtis Major Planum (a shiled volcano) and Isidis Planitia (and impact basin), just north of the equator; it contains four major settlements, with a total population around 280 thousand people.

## History

The earliest settlement in the area was The Ditch, which was constructed in BF 36; it's old enough that it was associated with an old-Earth national government, the United States, and was simply called the "Syrtis Major Site."
The installation became effectively independant when the US lost the ability to meaninfully operate on Mars; it was then briefly claimed by Hypercorporate interests, but went with the Argonauts when they separated from the Consortium.
It has been in Argonaut hands ever since.

The region is not near any of the major domed cities, and for decades, the Ditch was the only major settlement in the area.
Then, in BF 4, Cognite decided to built an installation on the surface of Mars, and began construction of Endicott City.
The Polygons followed in BF 1, and Gravel was constructed in AF 7.
As the population in the area has grown — and the area's politics have become more complicated — the area's civil government has built more infrastructure, constructing a proper "county seat" just outside the semi-official borders of Endicott, with a small spaceport under construction to the southeast.

It was the Argonauts that named the region in BF 28; it was named not for Huygens Crater, which sits hundreds of kilometers to the southwest, but indirectly for the Isidis Planitia, which was the first surface feature recorded on Mars by Christiaan Huygens.
