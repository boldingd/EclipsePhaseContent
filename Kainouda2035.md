# Kainouda 2035

Kainouda 2035 is an asteroid colony in the main belt.
It was originally an Extropian project: it was claimed by the Kainouda 2035 Development Company (The KDC), which then sold shares of it to other parties, chiefly Extropians, for development.
Since then, it has come to be dominated by the Thistledown Cooperative, a large Extropian Mutualist cooperative – although large swaths of the asteroid are still run along anarco-capitalist lines, and it hosts outposts of several other polities as well.

> **Anarcat**: this hab is kind of what I love about the belt; so many different people and communities, all crammed in together, and managing to get along pretty well.

> **Apotheotician**: Why thank you.  Also, hello; I'm the local they called in for comment.

## History

Kainouda 2035 is an oblong metallic asteroid in the main belt; it's about 43km long (along its major axis) and about 23km in diameter at its widest point (along its minor axis).
As the name suggests, it was first sighted from Earth in 2035; of course, it was only settled much later.
It was purchased in BF 21 by the Kainouda Development Company; it was then divided into lots and sold for development, along Extropian lines.

The asteroid was originally occupied mostly by a mix of Extropian anarcho-capitalists and mutualists.
However, over time, several of the Mutualist communities cooperated on large infrastructure projects, constructing large habs, minifacturing facilities, and power systems.
In BF 13, several mutualist communities formed the Thistledown Cooperative, an organization to coordinate the construction of large mutualist projects and own and administer the results along mutualist-socialist lines.
As the mutualists communities grew in size and influence, some an-caps began to fear the "expansionist" mutualists, leading to tensions between an-caps and mutualists.

> **Minerva**: Which is somewhat amusing, because Mutualist and Anarcho-Capitalists are both stateless propertarian systems.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Imagine looking at market-anarchists and being terrified of "socialism".
>
> **Anarcat**: I mean, there is a meaningful difference; mutualists use social-ownership schemes that "proper" an-caps don't.

In BF 11, the Thistledown Cooperative began the design and planning for a large central cavern, and for spinning the asteroid for centrigrav.
This became a contentious issue in Kainouda politics, and drove tenstions between the Thistledown Cooperative and other communities even higher.
Over the early months of BF 10, there where sporadic instances of violence targetting mutualists and mutualist communities.
However, highly agrieved an-caps failed to recruit many of their fellow an-caps or produced large-scale resistance; in the late months of BF 10 and the early months of BF 9, there was an exodus of "resistance" an-caps, leaving the Thistledown Cooperative in control of more than half of Kainouda 2035.

> **Apotheotician**: This was bad times, but it could've been a lot worse.
> Credit to our an-cap neighbors, most of them where fine with the Cooperative, so the violent anti-mutualists failed to recruit and couldn't get a lot of support.
> Most of these guys have since given up and left.

Ultimately, the Thistledown Chamber was constructed, and the asteroid was spun — around its long axis, producing 0.18G at the "equator" — in BF 8.

As the economy of Kainouda 2035 developed, as more infrastructure was constructed, and as the plans to spin the asteroid advanced, it began to become appealing territory.
In BF 9, the Infinite Loop Consortium, a member of the Planetary Consortium, purchased space on the asteroid, and administered it along PC lines.

During the Fall, the KDC constructed several habs near the asteroid; the habs where owned by the KDC, much like the asteroid, but the rights where sold to "cooperatives" that, in turn, consisted of the infugees and refugees that where settled there.
Essentially, the habs where given to their refugee residents, and they where allowed to organize them as they saw fit.
Today, only one of the five habitats is still run along Extropian lines; three of them where reorganized as Planetary Consortium hypercorps, and one of them is run by a scum swarm.

Today, the asteroid is more than 90% Extropian — and more than 50% of it is held by the Thistledown Cooperative, allowing them to dominate its politics.
However, enclaves of hypercapitalists, scum and social-anarchists can be found, making Kainouda 2035, in true Belter fashion, something of a crossroads.

## The Kainouda Development Company

Technically, the KDC still owns the asteroid, and is still the forum under which certain "whole asteroid" issues are resolved.
The initial development was done along Extropian anarcho-capitalist lines, much in the same way that the *Extropy Now!* corporation began the development of Extropia.
KDC purchased the asteroid, and then sold the development rights to tracts of it along anarcho-capitalist lines; the terms of these agreements required that residents defer to the KDC Forum for certain whole-asteroid concerns – notably including defense – but otherwise left purchasers at complete liberty as to how they used their property.

The KDC Forum was where the controversial decision to spin the asteroid for gravity was hashed out; the KDC also maintains the asteroid's defences, as well as a few notable pieces of infrastructure (including the Kainouda Long-Range Communication and Egocasting Consortium, and several surface solar installations).

In true Extropian fashion, the original purchasers of the asteroid wanted the KDC to have as small a role as it possibly could, preferring that residents rely as much as possible on private, voluntary contract.

### Long-Range Communications

The KDC manages the Kainouda Long-Range Communications and Egocasting Consortium — much more commonly called the "Comms Consortium," understandably.
Originally, communication was handled by two an-cap microcorps, the larger of which owned two communications sattelites, and the smaller of which owned a third.
Both sattelites orbit between 151km and 153km from the asteroid; they use high-bandwidth microwave and terrahertz links to communicate with a network of "ground stations" on the surface of the asteroid.
The ground stations are attached to each other and to terminals deep within the rock by high-speed superconducing and fiber links.
The network of "ground stations" where shared between the two microcorps and jointly maintained.
In BF 11, Experia opened a terminal on the asteroid, and also put a sattelite in orbit; building a parallel network of ground-stations proved impractical, so they joined the "consortium" to share and maintain the ground station network.
In BF 5, Experia launched a second sattelite; in BF 3, the Thistledown Cooperative launched a sattelite of their own, and joined the ground-station consortium.
In BF 2, a special contract was established between the ground-station consortium and the KDC — because the ground-station network represented a vital piece of shared infrastructure.

> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Ah yes, the efficiency of capitalism.
>
> **Anarcat**: What are you talking about?  Three different political factions are equitably sharing one piece of infrastructure.  What don't you like?
>
> **RategoryTheory**: Don't take the bait.
>
> **Kai**: He's from Mars, he may mean "why are you launching sattelites and having them fire microwaves at ground-stations when you're on an asteroid."
>
> **Anarcat**: That's actually a pretty common scheme.  Orbital velocity for the asteroid is *very* slow — much slower than the angular velocity at the surface, because it's spun for gravity.  And if you're 150km away, the asteroid takes up a much smaller slice of the sky, instead of blocking off half of it like if you where on the surface.  So it ends up being a lot easier to aim at whatever part of the sky you need to.
>
> **Kai**: It's also easy to expand, you just launch another sattelite.
> 
> **Anarcat**: It's easier to build, too.  Remember that the asteroid is spun for gravity; anything you build on the surface will be *hanging off*.  It's a lot easier to hang a small ground-station receiver than it is to hang a large comms spar.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Jesus.  I *meant* how you need six sattelites, because you people can't share.
>
> **Apotheotician**: Actually, they do share, and we actually do need all that capacity.  Pick a 48 hour window and we'll probably hit 85% utilization at some point.  Pick a five-day window and we'll probably exceed our total cap.

The Comms Consortium manages the maintenance and sharing of the ground-station and cabling; it also manages a bandwidth-sharing arrangement between the various sattelites.
The bandwidth-sharing arrangement uses a "peering model" — basically meaning that they share equitably as-required, rather than paying each other for capacity.
The Comms Consortium is also responsible for maintaing the security of the system: the microwave and hard-line links all use quantum encryption, which needs to be coordinated between the system's different users.

> **Apotheotician**: See?  Equitable, efficient sharing.  Which is kind of a problem if you're a Sentinel, because you can't guarantee your ego won't travel over Experia hardware at some point — if you're the kind of person where that would be problem, for example.
>
> **Anarcat**: So, compromising the cables is pointless because of the quantum encryption; I'm guessing the ground stations have significant security?
>
> **Apotheotician**: Oh, yes.  Not my area of expertise, but the hardware types usually write it off as "not worth the trouble," like most high-security handle-your-ego parts of any given hab.
>
> **Kai**: Spoiler: if you need to get onto the Thistledown discretely, either use the spaceport, use surface access, or, smartest way, dark-cast to Limehouse and then purchase an egocast over the local mesh from any random an-cap with a radio.
>
> **GoodNewsHarbinger**: Or bring along some infosec talent that can make some room once you've got local mesh access.
>
> **Kai**: Or that, yes.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Or bring a bot and EVA.
>
> **Anarcat**: Like that stunt you pulled in, *ah*, the hab where squatters had hung japanese lanterns everywhere.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Ha!  Exactly like that.

### Kainouda Defence

## The Thistledown Cooperative

The Thistledown Cooperative is a large Extropian Mutualist cooperative that has come to dominate the affairs of Kainouda 2035.
Almost five hundred thousand people are members of the Thistledown Cooperative — a solid majority of the asteroid's population.
The Thistledown Cooperative also owns more than two-thirds of the asteroid's habitable volume, and large portions of its vital infrastructure.
The Cooperative's major holding is Thistledown Cavern, a massive, cylindrical cavern laid out along the axis of rotation (a little like a Jovian "Reagan Cylinder," although the residents prefer to call it a "Bear Habitat").

## Other Extropians

### The Spaceport

## Infinite Loop

## Near-Orbit Habs

During the Fall, the KDC led the hasty construction of 5 modular habs in orbit of Kainouda 2035; many of those Fall refugees still live there.
A number of smaller habs have also been built nearby — although out of the volume claimed by the KDC and covered by the asteroid's defences.

## The Carbon Compact

The Carbon Compact a small Extropian habitat in orbit around Kainouda 2035.
It is held by a single cooperative, and is run using a using a unique economic and political system intended to use market dynamics to make political decisions.
Much like a Mutualist cooperative, the habitat, its major infrastructure, and many of its held resources are collectively owned, but "loaned" to members for productive use; their productive output is then exchanged in an open market.
However, their political system is also market-based: much as individuals are given a fixed ammount disbursement of a local social money, they are also given a fixed disbursement of *political* currency; individuals can then spend *more* or *less* of their political currency when voting, to have a larger or smaller effect, correlating to how strong their preferences are in a given vote.

> **Anarcat**: God, this frustrates me.
> Some people call these kinds of habs "utilitarians," like that's a political faction.
> Utilitarianism isn't a political or economic system, and its definitely not a faction.
> Anyone can be a utilitarian; I, for example, am a utilitarian *Titanian*, and I live on a *Mutualist* habitat.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Tip your fedora more.
>
> **Anarcat**: Only if you get basic terminology right.

### The Habitat

The Carbon Compact is a small Cole-bubble habitat, made from a small C-type asteroid (hence the "carbon" part of the name) that was towed into orbit around the Thistledown.
The Compact is only 245m in diameter, and is spun to a third of a G at the equator — roughly Martian surface gravity.

> **Anarcat**: If you're the kind of person who often jumps toward or off of spinning habs, that's about 1 RPM even, with an tangential velocity of about 27m/s at the equator.

A environment suitable for baseline humans is maintained in the habitat.
It's kept at 1atm of pressure, with temperatures running from 5C to 30C based on the time and season.
A day-night cycle is maintained, as is a seasonal cycle (with an eight month "year").
The habitat is sealed, without window-strips, and uses a plasma-tube for lighting.
It includes a number of *wind breaks* and a few large dividers, in order to break up "rolling storms."

### Extropian System

Their particular Extropian scheme uses collective ownership much like a Mutualist cooperative.
The Carbon Compact owns the habitat, its infrastructure, its major productive capitol, and its resource stores.
The Compact uses a social-money scheme: every member gets an equal pay-out of their social currency, the Carbon Credit.
The Carbon Credit can then be used to bid for access to raw materials and productive equipment, or to purchase goods that other members produce.

At any given time, some resources are banked, some are disbursed to citizens, some are auctioned off for local use, and some are auctioned for export; only goods made for export-marked resources can be priced in credits or sold to outsiders.

Unusually, their political system is also market-based.
Rather than granting each member one vote in each election, each member is granted an equal amount of their political currency, the Carbon Voice, every three months; they can then spend that currency in elections.
Spending more Voice allows someone to have a greater impact on an election.
The theory is that this allows for a more expressive political system, that captures the fact that any given issue will be more important to some people than to others.
In order to also represent the fact that some people may not care very much about governance at all, members are allowed to sell up to a quarter of their Voice in for other members Credits.

> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: That seems like a very bad idea.
>
> **Minerva**: It is like Sam Harris fans took a poly-sci introductory course while very high.
>
> **Apotheotician**: It works out about like you'd think.
> 
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Specifically letting people sell their votes, though.
> That's a *very* bad idea.
> What stops me from showing up with a sack of credits, buying everyone's spare votes, and then electing myself King of Carbon Mountain?
>
> **Anarcat**: you're too subby to be a king?
>
> [@Anarcat has received a warning.]

### Society

The habitat has a permanent population of about eight and a half thousand; it can host up to roughly four thousand temporary residents, consisting of students, visiting scholars, and vacationers.

The asteroid has two major industries: Kainouda Area Independent University, together with a handful of satellite labs; and a system of resorts covering half of the "equatorial strip" of the hab.
KAIU is well-regarded (maintaining a solid R-rep), and boasts particularly strong industrial engineering and economics programs.
It is notable for being connected to both the Kainouda Area Research Corporation (which focuses on industrial engineering) and the Carbon Institute (an economics think-tank).
The hab also hosts a number of resorts, including the Carbon Cove, a community sprawling over 230m of the equator, modelled (loosely) on the Greek mediterranean.

> **Apotheotician**: And now you know why they have rules for efficiently selling stuff to outsiders.
> 
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Holy fuck Minerva was right about these people.
>
> **Minerva**: Thank you, @Gunslinger.
>
> **Kai**: I think I'd start killing people if I had to stay at that resort.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Run by utilitarians, based on the "Greek mediterranean."  "Loosely!"
>
> **Anarcat**: I think you two are going a little overboard.

The locals have a conservationist bent and a long-term view; they emphasize sustainability over growth, and tend to draw lightly on their resources.

# The Old Text I'm Slicing From

Kainouda 2035 is an asteroid colony in the main belt.  It was originally an Extropian project: it was claimed by the Kainouda 2035 Development Company, which then sold shares of it to other parties, chiefly Extropians, for development.  Over time, several mutualist co-ops conglomerated, and their combined territory came to cover most of the rock; they then reorganized themselves into a direct-democratic polity.  Even though the vast majority of the Thistledown is controlled by that cooperative, it is still technically owned by the Kainouda Development Company, and that company remains the major forum for “whole asteroid” affairs.  Substantial parts of the Thistledown are still owned and occupied by Extropians, most notably the space-port; there is also a small Hypercorp presence, centered around Infinite Loop, a series of small warrens connected by a tram.  The Thistledown is a major outpost for the rare breed of Hypercorp that seeks to maintain a good relationship with either outer-system Anarchists or Titanians.
The asteroid also has a small warren of Objectivists, who are performing experimental psychosurgery on themselves.  Minerva is part of a team of psychologists who are studying the collapse of social order in that burrow.
The Thistledown is one of the few “Reagan Cylinders” outside of the Jovian system – the locals prefer to call it a Bear Cylinder or Bear Colony.  The asteroid has a hollow cavity running through it, and it has been spun to provide gravity; this cavity was constructed by the Thistledown Commonwealth, and is their major territory.  Unlike most Reagan Cylinders, the Thistledown Cavern takes up only a part of the volume of Kainouda 2035: the asteroid is almost 30km long and 9km in radius at the widest, but the Cavern is only 15km long, and 4.5km in radius.  This is largely because the Cavern is surrounded by burrows and habitats that the Thistledown Commonwealth does not control.  The asteroid is only spun to 0.2G gravity, largely because of the presence of those burrows – both because they weaken the cavern floor, and because the early burrows were not designed to bear up under gravity.
While they are not directly associated with the asteroid, there are four cluster habitats located near it – less than a hundred kilometers away, in fact.  These habitats have a population of roughly one-thousand each.  They were built by the populace of Kainouda 2035 during the fall to house infugees.  Since they are populated by infugees form Earth, most of them are nominally run as transitional economies, along standard Hypercorp lines.  However, since they were built quickly to host evacuees, they generally do not have the resources or facilities to run a transitional economy, and so three of the four habitats remain “stalled”.  Formal government has collapsed on the fourth, and it is now a Scum habitat.
You were on Kainouda 2035 very briefly at the beginning of Chapter 3; it was not described in detail at that time.  This is where Yellow Dog Imports is located; YDI is the company that Miguel D'Icaza runs.  Miguel, in turn, was the Proxy you met at the start of Chapter 3, before you were sent to the Wildfire facility for the real briefing.  (That was a complex chapter.)  Miguel was also the person who sent CV, Misandry and Pills to Titan during one of the one-shot arcs; however, as they ego-cast in, the asteroid was once again not described.
Your team returned to the asteroid for Chapter 9, when you were tasked with tracking down Henry Markram, who was believed to have gone there aboard the Black Jack Davey.  In Chapter 9, it was described in much greater detail.
The Thistledown Commonwealth also funds several other projects.  They host an Argonaut library inside the Cavern itself – although the Argonauts also have an independently-held burrow elsewhere on the asteroid.  The Thistledown Cooperative funds the Thistledown Open Culture Center, an umbrella operation that runs several smaller groups, including a museum, an art gallery and an Argonaut-style open exchange for several disciplines of what we would today call the humanities.

Kainouda 2035 and The Thistledown
    • Kainouda 2035 has 700K people living on it
    • Thistledown Cavern itself houses half of that – 450 thousand people
        ◦ that cavern is 35km long and 8km wide, give or take – check those numbers, or edit Program document.
        ◦ Original program document: 15km long, 6km wide, cavern 4.5km high.  Spun to 0.2G (make that less?)
        ◦ Cavern is internal – it has no end-cap access.
        ◦ Extropians manage the Spaceport at one end, and smaller Extropian warrens have deliberately resisted cavern expansion on the other end, out of spite.
        ◦ It has a light-tube above, which also includes some built-up regions (but small)
            ▪ think that's above cloud layer
    • History
        ◦ bought by Kainouda 2035 Development Company in BF20+
        ◦ leased-in-perpetuity to Extropians
        ◦ Mutualists grew faster than Capitolists, cooperated better, built better infrastructure
        ◦ Bad Years, when most capitolists left, remainder fought with Mutualists and lost
        ◦ Mutualist concerns form Thistledown Cooperative, a Market-Socialist state a little like Titan (or Belt-Con)
        ◦ people vote → set state policy → administer public concerns (banks)
        ◦ capitols and resources go to individuals as long as used productively, goods exchanged on open market
            ▪ bank-mediated exchange can sell goods outside of Mutualist enclave (e.g. to Capitolists)
            ▪ individuals get labor product, all capitol owned by banks (which are organs of state)
        ◦ people vote → set policy → policy works banks → banks and policy work tier-two public co-ops → other services provided by market exchange
        ◦ all citizens get autonomist-lifestyle-worth from Banks/community
        ◦ other groups still present, Extropians run spaceport, hypercorps run Infinite Loop, other small warrens
    • present nearby:
        ◦ several <1K cluster habs, built to house infugees during the Fall
        ◦ it is disputed whether they're Scum or Consortium

Thistledown Ideas
    • central cavern is not divided into chambers, like actual Thistledown
    • cavern floor divided into “modules”, with some modules grouped into districts
    • Some irregular mountains, where they couldn't get around existing construction
    • laid out a little like Gerlach
        ◦ a few large “cities” or “districts” with high buildings clustered tightly together, people densely packed
            ▪ “stretching up half the heigh of the chamber”, about 2km high
        ◦ large stretches of greenery
        ◦ a few smaller “towns”
        ◦ terraced in some places, like a park
        ◦ vertiginous, with different things on top of and under each other (e.g. “park blocks” with living and working space under them)
            ▪ freerunning especially popular
        ◦ trenches of through-way, shop and residence in the walls below park sections
    • Point of interest: Thistledown Open Culture Center
        ◦ houses ampitheaters and stages
        ◦ hosts servers for “arxiv/argonaut – style” peer-reviewed open exchange of history papers
        ◦ aiming to be second-best location for the humanities, outside of Titan
        ◦ at the heart of “Kerouac City” (technically, Kerouac Metro Area, spanning several modules with their own names)
    • Point of Interest: the Lonely Mountain
        ◦ complex of Extropian warrens above what would have been the chamber floor
        ◦ two forrest modules on either side, a river connecting the two, cut below the warrens
        ◦ inside the mountain, at cavern floor level, Proudhon Mutual Market, where market socialists and anarco-capitolists exchange
    • Axis City,  small installation on the axis itself
        ◦ public space and public facilities
        ◦ Seat of thistledown's education or sciences?
Other sites on Kainouda
    • The Spaceport, controlled by Extropians, and the Kainouda Tourist Company
    • The Infinite Loop, administered by a Hypercorp Conglomerate
        ◦ where Yellow Dog Imports is located, among others
        ◦ three large warrens roughly equally distributed around a slice of the asteroid
        ◦ forward, before Thistledown Cavern opens, behind the spaceport
        ◦ a literal loop that the tram runs over, that also has stops at some small Extropian warrans, some minor hypercorp habs, and a few “hole-in-the-wall” habs
    • large parts are strung together by different tram lines
        ◦ there's one running “beneath” the cavern floor of Thistledown Cavern, which junctures to the independent one that serves the Infinite Loop, and the independent one that serves the Spaceport (which is just as much an internal cargo-moving system)
    • Taggart Burrow, an Objectivist hold-out and major source of terrorist attacks
        ◦ conducts research into dangerous psycho-surgery
        ◦ other Extropians think of Objectivists the way everyone else thinks of Extropians, as dangerous and deluded sociopaths that no-one else really wants to deal with

Tentatively (re-)named one of the stations *Limehouse*, after the part of london where the opium dens where.
