# Kainouda 2035

Kainouda 2035 is an asteroid colony in the main belt.
It was originally an Extropian project: it was claimed by the Kainouda 2035 Development Company (The KDC), which then sold shares of it to other parties, chiefly Extropians, for development.
Since then, it has come to be dominated by the Thistledown Cooperative, a large Extropian Mutualist cooperative – although large swaths of the asteroid are still run along anarcho-capitalist lines, and it hosts outposts of several other polities as well.

## History

Kainouda 2035 is an oblong metallic asteroid in the main belt; it's about 43km long (along its major axis) and about 23km in diameter at its widest point (along its minor axis).
As the name suggests, it was first sighted from Earth in 2035; of course, it was only settled much later.
It was purchased in BF 21 by the Kainouda Development Company, and was then divided into lots and sold for development along Extropian lines.

The asteroid was originally occupied mostly by a mix of mutualist and anarcho-capitalist Extropians.
However, the Mutualist communities, with their central, democratically-managed banks, proved to have a greater ability to cooperate on infrastructure development.
In BF 13, several mutualist communities formed the Thistledown Cooperative, an organization that functions as much like a left-minarchist state as a large mutualist cooperative.
Many of the rocks anarcho-capitalists came to view this large, powerful faction with skepticism and fear; tensions rose.

> **Minerva**: That conflict is somewhat amusing, because Mutualist and Anarcho-Capitalists are both stateless propertarian systems.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Imagine looking at market-anarchists and being terrified of "socialism".
>
> **anarcat**: You understand mutualism has a collective-ownership mechanism, right?

In BF 11, the Thistledown Cooperative began the design and planning for a large central cavern, and for spinning the asteroid for centrigrav.
This became a contentious issue in Kainouda politics, and drove tensions between the Thistledown Cooperative and other communities even higher.
Over the early months of BF 10, there where sporadic instances of violence targeting mutualists and mutualist communities.
However, the small violent contingent failed to convince the wider an-cap community; so, in the late months of BF 10 and the early months of BF 9, there was an exodus of "resistance" an-caps.
This left even more of Kainouda 2035 in the hands of the Thistledown Cooperative.

> **Apotheotician**: These were bad times, but it could've been a lot worse.
> Credit to our an-cap neighbors; most of them had no problem with the Cooperative.

Ultimately, the Thistledown Chamber was constructed, and the asteroid was spun — around its long axis, producing 0.18G at the "equator" — in BF 8.

As the economy of Kainouda 2035 developed, as more infrastructure was constructed, and as the plans to spin the asteroid advanced, it began to become appealing territory.
In BF 9, the Infinite Loop Consortium, a member of the Planetary Consortium, purchased space on the asteroid, which they in turn leased to a small cast of Extropian- and Autonomist-friendly Hypercorps for development.

> **plasmage**: Wait, "Autonomist-friendly hypercorp?"
>
> **anarcat**: Yup!
> There aren't a ton of them, but they do exist.

During the Fall, several habs where constructed under the KDC's auspices near the asteroid; these habs where then donated to "cooperatives" that consisted of the infugees and refugees that where settled there.
Today, only one of the five habitats is still run along Extropian lines; three of them where reorganized along hypercorporate lines and subsequently joined the Planetary Consortium, and one of them is (effectively) occupied by a scum swarm.

Today, the asteroid (together with its nearby stations) is more than 90% Extropian — and more than 50% of it is held by the Thistledown Cooperative, allowing them to dominate its politics.
However, enclaves of hypercapitalists, scum and social-anarchists can be found, making Kainouda 2035, in true Belter fashion, something of a crossroads.

## The Kainouda Development Company

The KDC still performs several essential functions for the residents of Kainouda 2035, among them serving as the forum under which issues concerning the entire asteroid are to be resolved — for example, the decision to spin the asteroid for gravity.

The initial development was done along Extropian anarcho-capitalist lines, much in the same way that the *Extropy Now!* corporation began the development of Extropia.
KDC purchased the asteroid, divided it into lots, and sold the lots for further development; the terms of the sale agreements required that residents defer to the KDC Forum for certain whole-asteroid concerns (notably including defense), but otherwise left purchasers at complete liberty as to how they used their property.

The KDC Forum was where the controversial decision to spin the asteroid for gravity was hashed out.
It also maintains the asteroid's defenses, as well as a few notable pieces of infrastructure (including the Kainouda Long-Range Communication and Egocasting Consortium, and several surface solar installations).

### Long-Range Communications

The KDC manages the Kainouda Long-Range Communications and Egocasting Consortium — much more commonly called either the "Comms Consortium" or the "KCEC," understandably.
Originally, communication was handled by two an-cap microcorps, the larger of which owned two communications satellites, and the smaller of which owned a third.
Both satellites orbit between 151km and 153km from the asteroid; they use high-bandwidth microwave and terahertz links to communicate with a network of "ground stations" on the surface of the asteroid.
The ground stations are attached to each other and to terminals deep within the rock by high-speed superconducting and fiber links.
The network of "ground stations" where shared between the two microcorps and jointly maintained.
In BF 11, Experia opened a terminal on the asteroid, and also put a satellite in orbit; building a parallel network of ground-stations proved impractical, so they joined the "consortium" to share and maintain the ground station network.
In BF 5, Experia launched a second satellite; in BF 3, the Thistledown Cooperative launched a satellite of their own, and joined the ground-station consortium.
In BF 2, a special contract was established between the ground-station consortium and the KDC — because the ground-station network represented a vital piece of shared infrastructure.

> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Ah yes, the efficiency of capitalism.
>
> **anarcat**: What are you talking about?
> Three different political factions are equitably sharing one piece of infrastructure.
> What don't you like?
>
> **RategoryTheory**: Don't take the bait.
>
> **Bauble**: He's from Mars, he may mean "why are you launching satellites and having them fire microwaves at ground-stations when you're on an asteroid."
>
> **Anarcat**: That's actually a pretty common scheme.
> Orbital velocity for the asteroid is *very* slow — much slower than the angular velocity at the surface, because it's spun for gravity.
> And if you're 150km away, the asteroid takes up a much smaller slice of the sky, instead of blocking off half of it like if you where on the surface.
> So it ends up being a lot easier to aim at whatever part of the sky you need to.
>
> **Bauble**: It's also easy to expand, you just launch another satellite.
> 
> **Anarcat**: It's easier to build, too.
> Remember that the asteroid is spun for gravity; anything you build on the surface will be *hanging off*.
> It's a lot easier to hang a small ground-station receiver than it is to hang a large comms spar.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Jesus.
> I *meant* how you need six satellites, because you people can't share.
>
> **Apotheotician**: Actually, they do share, and we do need all that capacity.  Pick a 48 hour window and we'll probably hit 85% utilization at some point.  Pick a five-day window and we'll probably exceed our total cap.

The Comms Consortium manages the maintenance and sharing of the ground-station and cabling; it also manages a bandwidth-sharing arrangement between the various satellites.
The bandwidth-sharing arrangement uses a peering model — basically, they share capacity as required, rather than paying each other for capacity.
The Comms Consortium is also responsible for maintaining the security of the system: the microwave and hard-line links all use quantum encryption, which needs to be coordinated between the system's different users.

> **Apotheotician**: See?  Equitable, efficient sharing.
> Which is kind of a problem if you're a Sentinel, because you can't guarantee your ego won't travel over Experia hardware at some point — if you're the kind of person where that would be problem, for example.
>
> **anarcat**: So, compromising the cables is pointless because of the quantum encryption; I'm guessing the ground stations have significant security?
>
> **Apotheotician**: Oh, yes.
> Not my area of expertise, but the hardware types usually write it off as "not worth the trouble," like most high-security handle-your-ego parts of any given hab.
>
> **Bauble**: Spoiler: if you need to get onto the Thistledown discretely, either use the spaceport, use surface access, or, smartest way, dark-cast to Limehouse and then purchase an egocast over the local mesh from any random an-cap with a radio.
>
> **plasmage**: Or bring along some infosec talent that can make some room once you've got local mesh access.
>
> **Bauble**: Or that, yes.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Or bring a bot and EVA.
>
> **anarcat**: Like that stunt you pulled in, *ah*, the hab where squatters had hung Japanese lanterns everywhere.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Ha!  Exactly like that.

### Kainouda Defense

## The Thistledown Cooperative

The Thistledown Cooperative is a large Extropian market-socialist cooperative that has come to dominate the affairs of Kainouda 2035; while nominally an Extropian cooperative, it has come to operate much like a (left-wing minarchist) state.
Almost three-hundred and fifteen thousand people are members of the Thistledown Cooperative — a solid majority of the asteroid's population.
The Thistledown Cooperative also owns more than two-thirds of the asteroid's habitable volume, and large portions of its vital infrastructure (like power and life-support systems).
The Cooperative's major holding is the Thistledown Cavern, a massive, cylindrical cavern laid out along the axis of rotation (a little like a Jovian "Reagan Cylinder," although the residents prefer to call it a "Bear Habitat").

### Structure of the Cooperative

The cooperative is organized along market-socialist lines, and run by direct-democratic vote.
The cooperative's various assets — its habitats, infrastructure, and productive capital — are owned collectively.
Infrastructure is administered by the cooperative directly; productive capital, like industrial mechs, minifacturies, and server farms, are held by member-owned community banks and leased to members of the cooperative.
These community banks then lease their managed capital back to their members.
There are several competing community banks; each bank is owned by its members, and each member of the Thistledown Cooperative is a member of exactly one of the various community banks.
The community banks and the cooperative itself are the only institutions allowed to charge rent.

> **RategoryTheory**: So, basically, I get to "own" a cornucopia machine, as long as I pay a recurring fee to an institution that the community controls?
>
> So, you guys went to a lot of trouble to re-invent market-anarchist taxes?
>
> **anarcat**: I mean, kind of.
> The intent is to create a social-distribution system that can run without a state.
>
> **RategoryTheory**: I mean, yes, obviously, but this doesn't strike you as inefficient?
> Or a maybe seem like wasted effort, given that they wound up with "basically a state" anyway?
>
> **Apotheotician**: No?
> What don't you like?
> Compare our system to the government of any Venusian habitat and tell me we're the ones wasting effort.
>
> **Bauble**: Spoiler: it's the socialist part she doesn't like.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: I repeat: imagine looking at market-anarchists and saying "too socialist."

## Other Extropians

### Other Mutualists

### Anarcho-Capitalists

### The Spaceport

### Objectivists

## Minarchists

## Hypercorps

### Infinite Loop

### Outer System Industries

## Near-Orbit Habs

During the Fall, the KDC led the hasty construction of 5 modular habs in orbit of Kainouda 2035; many of those Fall refugees still live there.
A number of smaller habs have also been built nearby — some as members of the KDC, others not.
(Of course, the ones that aren't KDC members are built outside of the volume claimed by the KDC and covered by the asteroid's defenses.)

## The Carbon Compact

The Carbon Compact a small Extropian habitat in orbit around Kainouda 2035.
It is held by a single cooperative, and is run using a using a unique economic and political system intended to use market dynamics to make political decisions.
Much like a Mutualist cooperative, the habitat, its major infrastructure, and many of its held resources are collectively owned, but "loaned" to members for productive use; their productive output is then exchanged in an open market.
However, their political system is also market-based: much as individuals are given a fixed ammount disbursement of a local social money, they are also given a fixed disbursement of *political* currency; individuals can then spend *more* or *less* of their political currency when voting, to have a larger or smaller effect, correlating to how strong their preferences are in a given vote.

> **anarcat**: God, this frustrates me.
> Some people call these kinds of habs "utilitarians," like that's a political faction.
> Utilitarianism isn't a political or economic system, and its definitely not a faction.
> Anyone can be a utilitarian; I, for example, am a utilitarian *Titanian*, and I live on a *Mutualist* habitat.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Tip your fedora more.
>
> **anarcat**: Only if you get basic terminology right.

### The Habitat

The Carbon Compact is a small Cole-bubble habitat, made from a small C-type asteroid (hence the "carbon" part of the name) that was towed into orbit around the Thistledown.
The Compact is only 245m in diameter, and is spun to a third of a G at the equator — roughly Martian surface gravity.

> **anarcat**: If you're the kind of person who often jumps toward or off of spinning habs, that's about 1 RPM even, with an tangential velocity of about 27m/s at the equator.

A environment suitable for baseline humans is maintained in the habitat.
It's kept at 1atm of pressure, with temperatures running from 5C to 30C based on the time and season.
A day-night cycle is maintained (with a 24-hour day), as is a seasonal cycle (with an eight month "year").
The habitat is sealed, without window-strips, and uses a plasma-tube for lighting.
It includes a number of *wind breaks* and a few large dividers, in order to break up "rolling storms."

### Extropian System

Their particular Extropian scheme uses collective ownership much like a Mutualist cooperative.
The Carbon Compact owns the habitat, its infrastructure, its major productive capitol, and its resource stores.
The Compact uses a social-money scheme: every member gets an equal pay-out of their social currency, the Carbon Credit.
The Carbon Credit can then be used to bid for access to raw materials and productive equipment, or to purchase goods that other members produce.

At any given time, some resources are banked, some are disbursed to citizens, some are auctioned off for local use, and some are auctioned for export; only goods made from export-marked resources can be priced in credits or sold to outsiders.

Unusually, their political system is also market-based.
Rather than granting each member one vote in each poll, each member is granted an equal amount of their political currency, the Carbon Voice, every three months; they can then spend that currency in elections.
Spending more Voice allows someone to have a greater impact on a particular vote.
The theory is that this allows for a more expressive political system, that captures the fact that any given issue will be more important to some people than to others.
In order to also represent the fact that some people may not care very much about governance at all, members are allowed to sell up to a quarter of their Voice to other members for Carbon Credits.
(Notably, purchased Voice cannot be used on certain issues or for certain major decisions.)

> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: That seems like a very bad idea.
>
> **Minerva**: It is like Sam Harris fans took a poly-sci introductory course while very high.
>
> **Apotheotician**: It works out about like you'd think.
> 
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Specifically letting people sell their votes, though.
> That's a *very* bad idea.

>
> **anarcat**: you're too subby to be a king?
>
> \[\@anarcat has received a warning.\]

### Society

The habitat has a permanent population of about eight and a half thousand; it can host up to roughly four thousand temporary residents, consisting of students, visiting scholars, and vacationers.

The asteroid has two major industries: Kainouda Area Independent University, together with a handful of satellite labs; and a system of resorts covering half of the "equatorial strip" of the hab.
KAIU is well-regarded (maintaining a solid R-rep), and boasts particularly strong industrial engineering and economics programs.
It is notable for being connected to both the Kainouda Area Research Corporation (which focuses on industrial engineering) and the Carbon Institute (an economics think-tank).
The hab also hosts a number of resorts, including the Carbon Cove, a community sprawling over 230m of the equator, modelled (loosely) on the Greek Mediterranean.

> **Apotheotician**: And now you know why they have rules for efficiently selling stuff to outsiders.
> 
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Holy fuck Minerva was right about these people.
>
> **Minerva**: Thank you, \@Gunslinger.
>
> **Bauble**: I think I'd start killing people if I had to stay at that resort.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Run by utilitarians, based on the "Greek Mediterranean."
> "Loosely!"
>
> **anarcat**: I think you two are going a little overboard.

The locals have a conservationist bent and a long-term view; they emphasize sustainability over growth, and tend to draw lightly on their resources.

## Limehouse

Limehouse is one of five module habitats constructed during the Fall to receive refugees.
Ownership of the habitats was given to the refugees who settled there, to organize as they saw fit; three ultimately went hypercapitalist, while the fourth organized itself as an Extropian cooperative.
The residents of Limehouse, however, failed to establish any kind of formal organization; whether the station is a Scum swarm or a failed society is something of a matter of perspective.

### History

The station was one of five constructed during the Fall to house refugees.
Almost 1100 physical refugees where settled on the station, and another two thousand infugees where stored there;
the initial population included a prison work-crew (guards and inmates) who hijacked an SOTV from Robins AFB, and a cache of some four-hundred-plus egos salvaged from the communications network of a Commonwealth-of-Nations-based minifacturing firm.

Ownership of the stations was granted to the refugees that where settled there, for them to organize as they saw fit.
Within fourteen months of the fall, three of the stations had opted to join the Planetary Consortium, and the fourth had organized itself as an Extropian cooperative — but Limehouse had failed to organize itself.
Three months after the station was turned over to its residents, a proposal to organize it along hypercorporate lines was brought to a vote and soundly defeated; no other proposals where successfully brought to a vote.
Since the station had been at least notionally granted as property to its resident, it might arguably have been extropian anarcho-capitalist by default, but a web of microcorps never developed.

As the situation continued, a certain amount of self-sorting occurred; those with the resources to do so left, while the stations became something of a catch-basin for the 

# The Old Text I'm Slicing From

Kainouda 2035 is an asteroid colony in the main belt.  It was originally an Extropian project: it was claimed by the Kainouda 2035 Development Company, which then sold shares of it to other parties, chiefly Extropians, for development.  Over time, several mutualist co-ops conglomerated, and their combined territory came to cover most of the rock; they then reorganized themselves into a direct-democratic polity.  Even though the vast majority of the Thistledown is controlled by that cooperative, it is still technically owned by the Kainouda Development Company, and that company remains the major forum for “whole asteroid” affairs.  Substantial parts of the Thistledown are still owned and occupied by Extropians, most notably the space-port; there is also a small Hypercorp presence, centered around Infinite Loop, a series of small warrens connected by a tram.  The Thistledown is a major outpost for the rare breed of Hypercorp that seeks to maintain a good relationship with either outer-system Anarchists or Titanians.
The asteroid also has a small warren of Objectivists, who are performing experimental psychosurgery on themselves.  Minerva is part of a team of psychologists who are studying the collapse of social order in that burrow.
The Thistledown is one of the few “Reagan Cylinders” outside of the Jovian system – the locals prefer to call it a Bear Cylinder or Bear Colony.  The asteroid has a hollow cavity running through it, and it has been spun to provide gravity; this cavity was constructed by the Thistledown Commonwealth, and is their major territory.  Unlike most Reagan Cylinders, the Thistledown Cavern takes up only a part of the volume of Kainouda 2035: the asteroid is almost 30km long and 9km in radius at the widest, but the Cavern is only 15km long, and 4.5km in radius.  This is largely because the Cavern is surrounded by burrows and habitats that the Thistledown Commonwealth does not control.  The asteroid is only spun to 0.2G gravity, largely because of the presence of those burrows – both because they weaken the cavern floor, and because the early burrows were not designed to bear up under gravity.
While they are not directly associated with the asteroid, there are four cluster habitats located near it – less than a hundred kilometers away, in fact.  These habitats have a population of roughly one-thousand each.  They were built by the populace of Kainouda 2035 during the fall to house infugees.  Since they are populated by infugees form Earth, most of them are nominally run as transitional economies, along standard Hypercorp lines.  However, since they were built quickly to host evacuees, they generally do not have the resources or facilities to run a transitional economy, and so three of the four habitats remain “stalled”.  Formal government has collapsed on the fourth, and it is now a Scum habitat.
You were on Kainouda 2035 very briefly at the beginning of Chapter 3; it was not described in detail at that time.  This is where Yellow Dog Imports is located; YDI is the company that Miguel D'Icaza runs.  Miguel, in turn, was the Proxy you met at the start of Chapter 3, before you were sent to the Wildfire facility for the real briefing.  (That was a complex chapter.)  Miguel was also the person who sent CV, Misandry and Pills to Titan during one of the one-shot arcs; however, as they ego-cast in, the asteroid was once again not described.
Your team returned to the asteroid for Chapter 9, when you were tasked with tracking down Henry Markram, who was believed to have gone there aboard the Black Jack Davey.  In Chapter 9, it was described in much greater detail.
The Thistledown Commonwealth also funds several other projects.  They host an Argonaut library inside the Cavern itself – although the Argonauts also have an independently-held burrow elsewhere on the asteroid.  The Thistledown Cooperative funds the Thistledown Open Culture Center, an umbrella operation that runs several smaller groups, including a museum, an art gallery and an Argonaut-style open exchange for several disciplines of what we would today call the humanities.

Kainouda 2035 and The Thistledown
    • Kainouda 2035 has 700K people living on it
    • Thistledown Cavern itself houses half of that – 450 thousand people
        ◦ that cavern is 35km long and 8km wide, give or take – check those numbers, or edit Program document.
        ◦ Original program document: 15km long, 6km wide, cavern 4.5km high.  Spun to 0.2G (make that less?)
        ◦ Cavern is internal – it has no end-cap access.
        ◦ Extropians manage the Spaceport at one end, and smaller Extropian warrens have deliberately resisted cavern expansion on the other end, out of spite.
        ◦ It has a light-tube above, which also includes some built-up regions (but small)
            ▪ think that's above cloud layer
    • History
        ◦ bought by Kainouda 2035 Development Company in BF20+
        ◦ leased-in-perpetuity to Extropians
        ◦ Mutualists grew faster than Capitolists, cooperated better, built better infrastructure
        ◦ Bad Years, when most capitolists left, remainder fought with Mutualists and lost
        ◦ Mutualist concerns form Thistledown Cooperative, a Market-Socialist state a little like Titan (or Belt-Con)
        ◦ people vote → set state policy → administer public concerns (banks)
        ◦ capitols and resources go to individuals as long as used productively, goods exchanged on open market
            ▪ bank-mediated exchange can sell goods outside of Mutualist enclave (e.g. to Capitolists)
            ▪ individuals get labor product, all capitol owned by banks (which are organs of state)
        ◦ people vote → set policy → policy works banks → banks and policy work tier-two public co-ops → other services provided by market exchange
        ◦ all citizens get autonomist-lifestyle-worth from Banks/community
        ◦ other groups still present, Extropians run spaceport, hypercorps run Infinite Loop, other small warrens
    • present nearby:
        ◦ several <1K cluster habs, built to house infugees during the Fall
        ◦ it is disputed whether they're Scum or Consortium

Thistledown Ideas
    • central cavern is not divided into chambers, like actual Thistledown
    • cavern floor divided into “modules”, with some modules grouped into districts
    • Some irregular mountains, where they couldn't get around existing construction
    • laid out a little like Gerlach
        ◦ a few large “cities” or “districts” with high buildings clustered tightly together, people densely packed
            ▪ “stretching up half the heigh of the chamber”, about 2km high
        ◦ large stretches of greenery
        ◦ a few smaller “towns”
        ◦ terraced in some places, like a park
        ◦ vertiginous, with different things on top of and under each other (e.g. “park blocks” with living and working space under them)
            ▪ freerunning especially popular
        ◦ trenches of through-way, shop and residence in the walls below park sections
    • Point of interest: Thistledown Open Culture Center
        ◦ houses ampitheaters and stages
        ◦ hosts servers for “arxiv/argonaut – style” peer-reviewed open exchange of history papers
        ◦ aiming to be second-best location for the humanities, outside of Titan
        ◦ at the heart of “Kerouac City” (technically, Kerouac Metro Area, spanning several modules with their own names)
    • Point of Interest: the Lonely Mountain
        ◦ complex of Extropian warrens above what would have been the chamber floor
        ◦ two forrest modules on either side, a river connecting the two, cut below the warrens
        ◦ inside the mountain, at cavern floor level, Proudhon Mutual Market, where market socialists and anarco-capitolists exchange
    • Axis City,  small installation on the axis itself
        ◦ public space and public facilities
        ◦ Seat of thistledown's education or sciences?
Other sites on Kainouda
    • The Spaceport, controlled by Extropians, and the Kainouda Tourist Company
    • The Infinite Loop, administered by a Hypercorp Conglomerate
        ◦ where Yellow Dog Imports is located, among others
        ◦ three large warrens roughly equally distributed around a slice of the asteroid
        ◦ forward, before Thistledown Cavern opens, behind the spaceport
        ◦ a literal loop that the tram runs over, that also has stops at some small Extropian warrans, some minor hypercorp habs, and a few “hole-in-the-wall” habs
    • large parts are strung together by different tram lines
        ◦ there's one running “beneath” the cavern floor of Thistledown Cavern, which junctures to the independent one that serves the Infinite Loop, and the independent one that serves the Spaceport (which is just as much an internal cargo-moving system)
    • Taggart Burrow, an Objectivist hold-out and major source of terrorist attacks
        ◦ conducts research into dangerous psycho-surgery
        ◦ other Extropians think of Objectivists the way everyone else thinks of Extropians, as dangerous and deluded sociopaths that no-one else really wants to deal with

Tentatively (re-)named one of the stations *Limehouse*, after the part of london where the opium dens where.
