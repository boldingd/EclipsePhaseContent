Kainouda 2035 is an asteroid colony in the main belt.
It was originally — and to a great extent still is — an Extropian project; it was claimed by the Kainouda 2035 Development Company (The KDC), which then sold shares of it to other parties, chiefly Extropians, for development.
Since then, it has come to be dominated by the Thistledown Cooperative, a large Extropian Mutualist cooperative – although large swaths of the asteroid are still run along anarcho-capitalist lines, and it hosts outposts of several other polities as well.

The asteroid is oblong, about 35km long (along its major axis) and 10km in diameter at its widest point (along its minor axis).
It is M-type, relatively rich in iron, nickel, and other metals, but poorer in organics, volatiles, and silicate rocks — although extensive mining and development has denuded it of most of its valuable metals.

The asteroid is spun for centrifugal gravity — a highly-controversial decision at the time, since it was originally colonized as a beehive.
It rotates at about 0.16rpm, providing 0.2G at the floor of the Thistledown chamber, and 0.29G at the surface.

> **anarcat**: That's about 600km/h tangential velocity on the asteroid's surface; trying to jump onto it is not advised.

## History

Kainouda 2035 is an oblong metallic asteroid in the main belt; it's about 43km long (along its major axis) and about 23km in diameter at its widest point (along its minor axis).
As the name suggests, it was first sighted from Earth in 2035; of course, it was only settled much later.
It was purchased in BF 21 by the Kainouda Development Company, and was then divided into lots and sold for development along Extropian lines.

The asteroid was originally occupied mostly by a mix of mutualist and anarcho-capitalist Extropians.
However, the Mutualist communities, with their central, democratically-managed banks, proved to have a greater ability to cooperate on infrastructure development.
In BF 13, several mutualist communities formed the Thistledown Cooperative, an organization that functions as much like a left-minarchist state as a large mutualist cooperative.
Many of the rocks anarcho-capitalists came to view this large, powerful faction with skepticism and fear; tensions rose.

> **Minerva**: That conflict is somewhat amusing, because Mutualist and Anarcho-Capitalists are both stateless propertarian systems.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Imagine looking at market-anarchists and being terrified of "socialism".
>
> **anarcat**: You understand mutualism has a collective-ownership mechanism, right?

In BF 11, the Thistledown Cooperative began the design and planning for a large central cavern, and for spinning the asteroid for centrigrav.
This became a contentious issue in Kainouda politics, and drove tensions between the Thistledown Cooperative and other communities even higher.
Over the early months of BF 10, there where sporadic instances of violence targeting mutualists and mutualist communities.
However, the small violent contingent failed to convince the wider an-cap community; so, in the late months of BF 10 and the early months of BF 9, there was an exodus of "resistance" an-caps.
This left even more of Kainouda 2035 in the hands of the Thistledown Cooperative.

> **Apotheotician**: These were bad times, but it could've been a lot worse.
> Credit to our an-cap neighbors; most of them had no problem with the Cooperative.

Ultimately, the Thistledown Chamber was constructed, and the asteroid was spun — around its long axis, producing 0.18G at the "equator" — in BF 8.

As the economy of Kainouda 2035 developed, as more infrastructure was constructed, and as the plans to spin the asteroid advanced, it began to become appealing territory.
In BF 9, the Infinite Loop Consortium, a member of the Planetary Consortium, purchased space on the asteroid, which they in turn leased to a small cast of Extropian- and Autonomist-friendly Hypercorps for development.

> **plasmage**: Wait, "Autonomist-friendly hypercorp?"
>
> **anarcat**: Yup!
> There aren't a ton of them, but they do exist.

During the Fall, several habs where constructed under the KDC's auspices near the asteroid; these habs where then donated to "cooperatives" that consisted of the infugees and refugees that where settled there.
Today, only one of the five habitats is still run along Extropian lines; three of them where reorganized along hypercorporate lines and subsequently joined the Planetary Consortium, and one of them is (effectively) occupied by a scum swarm.

Today, the asteroid (together with its nearby stations) is more than 90% Extropian — and more than 50% of it is held by the Thistledown Cooperative, allowing them to dominate its politics.
However, enclaves of hypercapitalists, scum and social-anarchists can be found, making Kainouda 2035, in true Belter fashion, something of a crossroads.

## The Kainouda Development Company

The KDC still performs several essential functions for the residents of Kainouda 2035, among them serving as the forum under which issues concerning the entire asteroid are to be resolved — for example, the decision to spin the asteroid for gravity.

The initial development was done along Extropian anarcho-capitalist lines, much in the same way that the *Extropy Now!* corporation began the development of Extropia.
KDC purchased the asteroid, divided it into lots, and sold the lots for further development; the terms of the sale agreements required that residents defer to the KDC Forum for certain whole-asteroid concerns (notably including defense), but otherwise left purchasers at complete liberty as to how they used their property.

The KDC Forum was where the controversial decision to spin the asteroid for gravity was hashed out.
It also maintains the asteroid's defenses, as well as a few notable pieces of infrastructure (including the Kainouda Long-Range Communication and Egocasting Consortium, and several surface solar installations).

### Long-Range Communications and the KCEC

The KDC manages the Kainouda Long-Range Communications and Egocasting Consortium — much more commonly called either "Com-Con" or the "KCEC," understandably.
Originally, communication was handled by two an-cap microcorps, the larger of which owned two communications satellites, and the smaller of which owned a third.
Both satellites orbit between 151km and 153km from the asteroid; they use high-bandwidth microwave and terahertz links to communicate with a network of ground stations on the surface of the asteroid.
The ground stations are attached to each other and to terminals deep within the rock by high-speed superconducting and fiber links.
The network of "ground stations" was shared between the two microcorps, and jointly maintained.

In BF 11, Experia opened a terminal on the asteroid, and also put a satellite in orbit; building a parallel network of ground-stations proved impractical, so they joined the "consortium" to share and maintain the ground station network.
In BF 5, Experia launched a second satellite; in BF 3, the Thistledown Cooperative launched a satellite of their own, and joined the ground-station consortium as well.
In BF 2, a special contract was established between the ground-station consortium and the KDC — because the ground-station network represented a vital piece of shared infrastructure, the integrity of which concerned the entire asteroid.

> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Ah yes, the efficiency of capitalism.
>
> **anarcat**: What are you talking about?
> Three different political factions are equitably sharing one piece of infrastructure.
> What don't you like?
>
> **RategoryTheory**: Don't take the bait.
>
> **Bauble**: He's from Mars, he may mean "why are you launching satellites and having them fire microwaves at ground-stations when you're on an asteroid."
>
> **anarcat**: That's actually a pretty common scheme.
> Orbital velocity for the asteroid is *very* slow — much slower than the angular velocity at the surface, because it's spun for gravity.
> And if you're 150km away, the asteroid takes up a much smaller slice of the sky, instead of blocking off half of it like if you where on the surface.
> So it ends up being a lot easier to aim at whatever part of the sky you need to.
>
> **Bauble**: It's also easy to expand, you just launch another satellite.
> 
> **anarcat**: It's easier to build, too.
> Remember that the asteroid is spun for gravity; anything you build on the surface will be *hanging off*.
> It's a lot easier to hang a small ground-station receiver than it is to hang a large comms spar.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Jesus.
> I *meant* how each capitalist society has to have its own satellites, because you people can't share.
>
> **Apotheotician**: Actually, they have a peering agreement, so they do share.
> And we do need all that capacity.
> Pick a 48 hour window and we'll probably hit 85% utilization at some point.
> Pick a five-day window and we'll probably exceed our total cap.

The KCEC manages the maintenance of the ground-stations and connective cabling, and it also oversees a bandwidth-sharing arrangement between the various groups with satellites in orbit.
The bandwidth-sharing arrangement uses a peering model — essentially, they share capacity as required, without attempting to track (and bill) their use of each-other's networks.

The Comms Consortium is also responsible for maintaining the security of the system: the microwave and hard-line links all use quantum encryption, which needs to be coordinated between the system's different users.

> **Apotheotician**: See?  Equitable, efficient sharing.
> Which is kind of a problem if you're a Sentinel, because you can't guarantee your ego won't travel over Experia hardware at some point — if you're the kind of person where that would be problem, for example.
>
> **anarcat**: So, compromising the cables is pointless because of the quantum encryption; I'm guessing the ground stations have significant security?
>
> **Apotheotician**: Oh, yes.
> Not my area of expertise, but the hardware types usually write it off as "not worth the trouble."
> Like most high-security handle-your-ego parts of any given hab.
>
> **Bauble**: Spoiler: if you need to get onto the Thistledown discretely, either use the spaceport, use surface access, or, smartest way, dark-cast to Limehouse and then purchase an egocast over the local mesh from any random an-cap with a radio.
>
> **plasmage**: Or bring along some infosec talent that can make some room once you've got local mesh access.
>
> **Bauble**: Or that, yes.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Or bring a bot and EVA.
>
> **anarcat**: Like that stunt you pulled in, *ah*, the hab where squatters had hung Japanese lanterns everywhere.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Ha!  Exactly like that.

### Defensive Systems and the KEDC

The KDC is also responsible for the defence of the asteroid, which is managed through the Kainouda External Defense Consortium.

One of the few on-going obligations that an owner incurrs when purchasing a plot of Kainouda 2035 from the KDC is to contribute dues to the KDC to pay for the ongoing defence of the asteroid; the KDC in turn does this via a special contract with the Kainouda External Defense Consortium.
The KEDC, in turn, contracts out to various microcorps to construct, operate, and crew the satellites defences.

Notably, contractors do not bring their own hardware; instead, the KEDC purchases defensive systems from construction microcorps, and then pays to have them crewed in seperate contracts; this is to prevent one contractor from holding the KDC hostage (metaphorically or literally).
The operation of the defensive systems are also broken into multiple contracts; this both helps to control prices, and to ensure that one failed contract renewal does not leave all of the asteroid's defenses uncrewed.

Like many large, prosperous habitats — especially those in the asteroid belt — Kainouda 2035's defense systems are substantial.

#### Satellites and Emplacements

Primary defense is provided by a fleet of satellites.
There are more than one hundred of them, built with various sizes, roles, and capabilities; they orbit at altitudes between 15km and 160km.
These include large weapons satellites, carrying batteries of anti-ship missiles, destroyer-scale particle-beam bolters, and point-defense systems; smaller satellites carrying radar, infrared, and other sensors; point-defense satellites capable of engaging missiles, fighters, and humans; on-station drones; and other satellites whose specifications the KEDC has not disclosed.

The orbits of these satellites are inclined so they do not pass in front of the axial space-ports — although because the satellites are orbiting and can rotate freely, this does not restrict their coverage or field of fire.

As a final measure, the asteroid also has some defense emplacements on its surface — although these are few, because they must be designed carry their own weight while "hanging" off the surface of the asteroid, and because their fields-of-view are limited compared to the orbiting satellites.

> **anarcat**: Short reminder: a grid of IR and radar sensors like that is *very* hard to defeat.
> Space is very cold, you are very not, and IR sensors are very good.
>
> And thermodynamics doesn't *actually* let you do most of the stuff that you've seen in movies.
> 
> **Apotheotician**: Again, not my area of expertise, but that's the impression I've got from the sneakier Sentinels that have come through: hard enough to be a practical impossibility.
> 
> Those point-defense satellites are the other problem: you get shredded very shortly after you're detected.
>
> **Bauble**: I'll say it again.
> This hab, like most habs, you'll want to dark-cast.
> Or find some way to go through the space-port "legit."
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: Stupid question, but could jamming or hacking work?
> I'm guessing jamming is a no-go because they've probably got ALIs on the platforms that take over.
>
> **anarcat**: I mean, *probably*.
> And I'm willing to bet that their communication to C&C is through farcasters, just like the communications satellites, so you'd probably have to hack the actual C&C system in the hab.
> And if you're hacking the *probably* air-gapped C&C system in the hab, you're already on board.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: OK, stop being a prick.
> I know you've defeated systems like this before; how'd you do it?
>
> **anarcat**: Short answer: small bots falling slowly.
> Carefully-designed bots can be very small, very dark, have very low radar signatures, and survive getting very cold.
> And they can afford to fall slowly, taking weeks or months to drift to the target.
>
> One time I used an orange — a literal orange!
> Flesh has a pretty low radar return, so I put a protean hive inside an orange, covered it in dull-black organic grease and adhesive, cooled it, and gently lobbed it at the target.
> Damn thing took two-and-a-half months to get captured and spiral in.
> When it hit, it stuck to the surface, made some proteans, the proteans scurried out and made a bot, and the bot pinged me.
>
> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: You're the devil.
>
> **H0N3**: Why couldn't you do that with a person?
>
> **anarcat**: Too big; either too warm or made of too much metal — sometimes both; too impatient to wait two months, and the breathy ones can't cary that much air; most of the breathy ones also can't get *that* cold, even in medical statis; too easy to see, because all these satellites and habs are also covered in cameras.
>
> **H0N3**: Why is falling slowly important?
> Why not fall quickly?
>
> **anarcat**: You need to burn thrusters to start and stop, and burning thrusters means being seen in IR.
> Cold-gas jets exist, but they aren't powerful, not enough to stop you if you get launched at high speed.
>
> **Bauble**: Or you could stop dragging it out with this bush-league spy-movie bullshit and BUY A FUCKING DARK-CAST.
>
> **anarcat**: Or that.

#### Ships

Ships and drones take a secondary role in defense.
The KDEC fields relatively few drones, relying on fewer than three dosen fighter craft.
In their place, it fields several larger craft, four "corvettes" and three "clippers."

The "corvettes" are intended to act as deterrants for larger attackers, like pirates.
The corvettes are about the size of an SOTV, and carry heavy weaponry: two of them are armed with batteries of anti-ship missiles, while the third carries a naval-scale particle-beam weapon and a point-defense system.

The "clippers," in turn, are intended to patrol commercial traffic in the space near the hab.
They are about the size of an LOTV, and are more lightly armed than the corvettes, carrying only two lower-energy particle-beam weapons; howevery, they also carry a large radar system, imaging and inspection systems, point-defense systems, and a small compliment of marines and security drones.

Of course, while these craft are durable, they are not armored the way that a destroyer would be.
Lacking a fusion (or antimatter) drive, they also do not have the range that a destroyer would.

## The Thistledown Cooperative

The Thistledown Cooperative is a large Extropian market-socialist cooperative that has come to dominate the affairs of Kainouda 2035.
Almost three-hundred and fifteen thousand people are members of the Thistledown Cooperative — a solid majority of the asteroid's population.
The Thistledown Cooperative also owns more than two-thirds of the asteroid's habitable volume, and large portions of its infrastructure (like power and life-support systems).
The Cooperative's major holding is the Thistledown Cavern, a massive, cylindrical cavern laid out along the axis of rotation (a little like a Jovian "Reagan Cylinder," although the residents prefer to call it a "Bear Habitat").

### Structure of the Cooperative

The cooperative is organized along market-socialist lines, and run by direct-democratic vote.
The cooperative's various assets — its habitats, infrastructure, and productive capital — are owned collectively.
Infrastructure is administered by the cooperative directly; productive capital, like industrial mechs, minifacturies, and server farms, are held by member-owned community banks and leased to members of the cooperative for productive use.
These community banks compete with one another, encouraging the efficient allocation of resources; each member of the Thistledown Cooperative is a member of exactly one community bank.
The community banks and the Cooperative itself are the only institutions allowed to charge rent.

> **RategoryTheory**: So, basically, I get to "own" a cornucopia machine, as long as I pay a recurring fee to an institution that the community controls?
>
> So, you guys went to a lot of trouble to re-invent market-anarchist taxes?
>
> **anarcat**: I mean, actually, yes.
> The intent is to create a social-distribution system that can run without a dangerous central authority.
> And hey, look at that, we did!
>
> **Apotheotician**: You say "we" but, for the record, you are not a member of the Thistledown Cooperative.
>
> **anarcat**: Oh, right.
> That's correct.
> I'm a mutualist, but I'm not from the Thistledown.
>
> **RategoryTheory**: \>\@anarcat I mean, yes, obviously, but this doesn't strike you as inefficient?
> Or maybe seem like wasted effort, given that they wound up with "basically a state" anyway?
>
> **Apotheotician**: No?
> Compare our system to the government of any Venusian habitat and tell me we're the ones wasting effort.
>
> And anyway, I thought you where a big fan of markets, what part of this don't you like?
>
> **Bauble**: Spoiler: it's the socialist part she doesn't like.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: I repeat: imagine looking at market-anarchists and saying "too socialist."
>
> **plasmage**: I'm just amused we got to see ratty and catty be on opposite sides of something.
> Usually the Firewall chapter of the John Stuart Mill fan-club are pretty much on the same page.
>
> **Padre**: We just need ratty and gunny to get on the same side of something, and we'll be right on track for the eschaton.
>
> **RategoryTheory**: \>\@Apotheotician It's the part where I'm still paying taxes — to a group I *have to join* — but we're not calling it a "government" so that's totally fine and we're totally still anarchists.
>
> Or, actually, it's the part where the not-a-government gets to tax me, but doesn't guarantee my rights or enforce laws I get to vote on or run an impartial court system or anything.
>
> **anarcat**: Well, it actually kind of does, funnily enough.
> I guess we'll find out if it meets with your approval when we get to that part of the write-up.

## Other Extropians

### Other Mutualists

Of course, there 

### Anarcho-Capitalists

### The Spaceport

### Objectivists

## Minarchists

## Hypercorps

A handful of Hypercorps also call Kainouda 2035 home — an appealing arrangement for hypercorps that do regular business with Extropian microcorps, or the rare breed that do business with outer-system Autonomists.
Most of these hypercorps are organized under the auspices of the Kainouda Holdings HyperConsortium, a consortium and holding company that exists to establish and maintain a hypercapitalist presence on the asteroid — and to shield those hypercorps from enemies within the consortium.

### The Kainouda Holdings HyperConsortium

The Kainouda Holdings HyperConsortium — is a holding-company and corporate consortium that was established to build a hypercapitalist hab-space in Kainouda 2035.
The KHHC was set up in BF 10 by hypercapitalist investors who wished to do business in the Extropian belt and Autonommist outer-system — some of which are known, and some of which remain undisclosed to this day.
Kainouda 2035 was viewed as a prime candidate early on, owing in part to the Thistledown Cooperative's plans to spin the asteroid — still in the preliminary stages in BF 10 — and a drop in "land" prices owing to the departure of so many anarco-capitalists.
KHHC was able to snap up a roughly-circular tract of territory aligned with the proposed axis of rotation for fairly cheap at the end of BF 10; several subsidiary hypercorps where established in January of BF 9, including Infinite Loop and Kainouda Support Industries and Provisions; and ground was broken for the transport track the same month.

Kainouda Holdings Hyperconsortium still operates today, and still (technically) owns much of the terrain that they purchased from the KDC.
In practice, though, they are little more than a holding company: they own Infinite Loop, KSIP, and several of the other subsidiaries that actually operate the infrastructure of the track.

Notably, since many of the KHHC's clients do business with autonomists, they frequently face significant pressure from within the Planetary Consortium; in order to insulate its clients from this pressure, KHC has a somewhat unusual internal set-up.
Wheras most hypercorps avoid being tied down to physical assets, it is not unusual for KHHC's tenants to purchase the rights to their modules outright.
It is also not unusual for KHHC tenants to purchase shares in the KHHC itself, creating a kind of circular relationship.
For example, OSI pays a service fee to Infinite Loop; KHHC owns a seventy-one-percent stake in Infinite Loop, so Infinite Loop pays dividents to KHHC; and OSI owns a ten-percent stake in KHHC, and could in principle receive dividents from KHHC, derived from fees that OSI paid.

> **Gunslinger\#MONOLITH**: They needed to build one centri-grav track, so they formed a keiretsu.
> Capitalism!
>
> **Bauble**: Weeb.

### Infinite Loop

In some ways, Infinite Loop is actually the hypercorp that defines the hypercapitalist presence on Kainouda 2035 — both culturally and physically.
Infinite Loop operates the circular transit track and "commons" that runs around the axis of rotation, and that all the modules constructed by KHHC are attached too; the Loop is 8km in radius, and experiences about 0.22G centrigrav. 
This network physically connects all the various KHHC modules, and provides easy transit between them; it also provides a continuous strip of "green space" for the use of residents.
Physically, the green-space is "above" the trams; its size varies, but it's usually about 25m across and 10m high.
The green-space is covered in small parks, paths, ponds, benches, pavillians, and "public" facilities — and, of course, dotted with shops, restaraunts and kiosks, as well as access-point to nearby Extropian-owned habs and tunnels.
The trams are "underground" (relative to the greenspace), and consist of two tracks, one running spinward and one running anti-spinward.

One disadvantage of this approach, given the low centrigrav of the asteroid, is that the apparent gravity varies significantly with the tram's motion; for this reason, the spinward tram is sometimes called the "high-grav line" or "crusher car," while the anti-spinward tram is called the "low-grav line" or the "bounce-car."
When the spinward line reaches speed, riders experience 0.46G — about twice the normal centrigrav in the loop, hence "crusher car."
On the other hand, when the anti-spinward car reaches speed, riders experience only 0.08G — less than half the normal gravity of the loop.

Notably, power, air, water, and data lines also run along the Loop, connecting the various hypercapitalist warrens to resources produced (or procured) by Kainouda Support Industries and Provisions.
(KSIP is responsible for maintaining the lines, despite their being located in the loop.)

### Kainouda Support Industries and Provisions

Kainouda Support Industries and Provisions is responsible for providing the various KHHC habs with power, life-support, and data services.
While they do have facilities of their own — including two small fusion power plants and several sizable sludge ponds — they purchase most of their power and life-support from other firms, including solar-power installations on the surface or in orbit.

### Habs

A number of hypercorps run habs connected to the loop, covering a wide array of designs, styles, and budgets.
Most are relatively small, around the size of old-Earth mid-rises and including housing for between 50 and 200 people, as well as shared recreational spaces.

> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: And the difference between a hypercorp hab and an extropian hab would be…
>
> **anarcat**: The fabbers are locked down, you get paid in real actual Bank-of-Progress credits and not a micro-currency pegged to them, and you're a hypercorp resident, so you get to "vote" for a rep in the Planetary Congress and your hypercorp gets representation in the Ministry.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: Right, their fabbers are locked down, unless they take a five-minute tram ride to ancapistan, where they can buy all the scary, subversive toys their hearts desire.
>
> **Apotheotician**: They don't even have to do that.
> There are a couple of Extropian microcorps that specialize in fabbing proscribed items and then delivering them to hypercorpers by drone.
>
> **Gunslinger#MONOLITH**: And K-whatever can't stop them from doing that?
>
> **Apotheotician**: The KHHC doesn't care.
> They're not super concerned about staying in the Hypercorp Council's good graces.

### Outer System Industries

Outer-Systems Industrias is one of the larger hypercorps based on the Thistledown.
An unusual hypercorp, they do business in the outer system, forming partnerships with autonomist groups.

OSI has found a number of niches in the outer system.
In particular:

- They operate a number of large-scale manufacturing facilities, providing production capabilities that smaller autonomist projects often lack;
  - in particular, this includes the production of morphs, animals, and bots, since these still cannot be produced effectively with nanofabrication.
- They contribute to open-source software and fab-blueprint projects, with the understanding that they can license those things and sell them for profit in the inner system.
- The produce goods covered by restrictive licenses, and exchange them for rep and local microcurrencies.

## Near-Orbit Habs

During the Fall, the KDC led the hasty construction of 5 modular habs in orbit of Kainouda 2035; many of those Fall refugees still live there.
A number of smaller habs have also been built nearby — some as members of the KDC, others not.
(Of course, the ones that aren't KDC members are built outside of the volume claimed by the KDC and covered by the asteroid's defenses.)

Limehouse is one of five module habitats constructed during the Fall to receive refugees.
Ownership of the habitats was given to the refugees who settled there, to organize as they saw fit; three ultimately went hypercapitalist, while the fourth organized itself as an Extropian cooperative.
The residents of Limehouse, however, failed to establish any kind of formal organization; whether the station is a Scum swarm or a failed society is something of a matter of perspective.

### History

The station was one of five constructed during the Fall to house refugees.
Almost 1100 physical refugees where settled on the station, and another two thousand infugees where stored there;
the initial population was diverse, including for example a prison work-crew (both guards and inmates) who hijacked an SOTV from Robins AFB in the United States, and a cache of some four-hundred-plus egos salvaged from the communications network of a Commonwealth-of-Nations-based minifacturing firm.

Ownership of the stations was granted to the refugees that where settled there, for them to organize as they saw fit.
Within fourteen months of the fall, three of the stations had opted to join the Planetary Consortium, and the fourth had organized itself as an Extropian cooperative — but Limehouse had failed to organize itself.
Three months after the station was turned over to its residents, a proposal to organize it along hypercorporate lines was brought to a vote and soundly defeated; no other proposals where successfully brought to a vote.
Since the station had been at least notionally granted as property to its resident, it might arguably have been extropian anarcho-capitalist by default, but a functional web of microcorps never developed.

As the situation continued, a certain amount of self-sorting occurred; those with the resources to do so left, while the stations became something of a catch-basin for the criminals, burn-outs and antisocial elements of the Kainouda 2035 "neighborhood."
Social organization on the station was eventually dominated by two groups: one centered around a pool of working-class refugees, who brought with them a certain "labour-party" social identity, and another centered around a small web of criminal gangs.

In the years since the fall, several of the stations residents have joined either the Circle-A or Guanxi networks — or both — and the stations' informal social structure, "punk anarchist" style, and open criminal element mark it as a Scum swarm.

### Organization

Like most Scum swarms, Limehouse has no formal organization, rule-making or governings systems, or economic system.
The locals tend to be anti-authoritarian, individualistic and libertine, and hedonistic.
Clear, mutual, informed consent and staying out of what doesn't concern you are the two corner-stones of society on Limehouse.

Unlike many other genera of anarchism, the Scum generally don't concern themselves with theory or hold themselves to formal process; instead, Scum swarms tend to run on a mix of personal authority, reputation, tradition, reciprocity, and violence — ranging from the pointed shove to the angry mob.
Limehouse is no different: there are no reputation scores, no affinity groups or workers' councils, and no public decision-making system.
The "civil society" of Limehouse instead runs on informal authority, a certain kind of tradition, and shouted obscenities.
Those who command the respect of their peers — either through toughness, a commanding personality, a reputation for getting important jobs done, or armed back-up — corral groups of their fellows into action.
People tend to repeat things that work, so people who prove to be good at keeping the station running — or enriching their followers — tend to get trusted with more power, and ad-hoc arrangements crystalize into crews, gangs, and bosses.

In practice, Limehouse is broken into crews and gangs.

## The Carbon Compact

| The Carbon Compact | |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Bear Hab (285m minor axis, 315m major axis; multiple chambers) |
| Gravity | Microgravity; 0.3G (main chamber, centrigrav); 0.5G (two secondary tracks, centrigrav) |
| Population | 8K permanent, up to 4K temporary |
| Languages | English, Mandarin, Arabic |
| Location | Main Belt (about five hundred kilometers from Kainouda 2035) |
| Faction | Extropian Mutualist |

The Carbon Compact a small (in relative terms) Extropian Mutualist habitat near (also in relative terms) Kainouda 2035.
It is held by a single cooperative, and is run using an unusual variant of direct democracy that is intended to capture the fact that not every votes is invested in every decision.
The Carbon Compact hosts a university, several affiliated think-tanks and research labs, and a number of small luxury resorts.

### The Habitat

In some ways, the Carbon Compact habitat is similar to the Thistledown, if much smaller.
It is also a Bear Habitat — an asteroid that has had a large central chamber constructed, which is then spun for gravity.
The Carbon Compact's habitat was constructed in a small, oblong, C-type asteroid (hence the "carbon" part of the name) that was towed into the orbital neighborhood of the Thistledown in AF 3.
The asteroid itself is irregular and oblong, about 315m on its long axis and 285m on its short axis.

The asteroid contains a single main chamber, about 285m long and 245m in diameter at the middle, and spun to 0.3G (a little less than Martian surface gravity).
(Note that the chamber itself is rotated, but the asteroid itself is not.)
Somewhat uniquely, the chamber's floor slopes "up-hill," giving it a layout a little bit like the interior of a bubble-hab; this means that the relative centrigrav is less the further you move from the "equator" of the chamber.
The chamber is only about 95m in diameter at the end caps; the centrigrav there is only 0.1G, which is low enough that Coriolis forces are noticable.

The asteroid also contains two smaller grav-tracks, built around the interior chamber at either end; this is one of the reasons that the chamber narrows.
These tracks are 230m in diameter, only about 60m "long", and spun up to 0.5G.
They do completely cancel the torque of the main chamber, but they do help manage precession; they also allow the Compact a limited degree of attitude control, by using them as reaction wheels (like Hamilton cylinders often do).

The habitat also contains a limited area of beehive tunnels; since the asteroid itself is not spinning, these tunnels are in microgravity.
They are viewed as relatively poor real-estate, and so they are often used for industrial and support equipment, as housing for the poor, and for installations that require strong security (since bing surrounded by rock walls provides good access-control).

An environment suitable for baseline humans is maintained in the habitat.
It's kept at 1atm of pressure, with temperatures running from 5C to 30C based on the time and season.
A day/night cycle is maintained (with a 24-hour day), as is a seasonal cycle (with an eight month "year").
The habitat is sealed, of course, and lacks window strips; a plasma tube is used for lighting in the main chamber, and lights are fixed to the "ceiling" of the smaller centrigrav tracks.
Rolling storms aren't much of a concern for a habitat so small, especially not when it is spun to such a low gravity; their only wind breaks are two rows of stylized columns running along the "prime meridian" of the main chamber.

### Extropian System

The Carbon Compact uses a collective-ownership mechanism similar to most other Mutualist habs.
The habitat, its infrastructure, its major productive capitol, and its resource stores are all held collectively, granted to member-owned "banks," and leased to members for productive use.
The Compact uses a social-money scheme, where every member gets an equal pay-out of their social currency, the Carbon Credit; those credit can then be used to bid for access to raw materials and productive equipment, or to purchase goods that other members produce.
At any given time, some resources are banked, some are disbursed to citizens, some are auctioned off for local use, and some are auctioned for export; only goods made from export-marked resources can be priced in credits or sold to outsiders.

They use a variant of direct-democratic voting to make political decisions.
Rather than granting each member one vote in each poll, each member is granted an equal amount of their political currency, the Carbon Voice, every three months; they can then spend that currency in elections.
Voters can spend a varying ammount of Voice in any given poll, allowing them to have a greater or lesser influence on the eventual outcome; the theory is that this allows for a more expressive political system, that captures the fact that any given issue will be more important to some people than to others.
In order to also represent the fact that some people may not care very much about governance at all, and to inject a measure of market efficiency into their politics, members are allowed to sell up to a quarter of their Voice to other members for Carbon Credits.

The system does have a few notable limits, intended to prevent abuse: some polls bar the use of purchased Voice, including revisions to their charter or decisions that "fundamentally" impact the entire hab (like adjusting the hab environment); and most polls have an upper limit on the ammount of Voice that any one person can spend (for example, a vote to adjust the amount of feed-stock allocated for external sale might limit each participant to spending no more than 3 Voice).

> They built "the rich get more say!" right into their political system!
>
> **Bauble**: Jesus christ!
> You can't not pick at ratty even when you agree with her!

### Society

The habitat has a permanent population of about eight and a half thousand, and can comfortably support another four thousand visitors.
Residents are from a diverse array of backgrounds, drawn from all over Earth and Luna; notable pockets where drawn from Hong Kong, Toronto, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Dubai.
Visitors, in turn, usually consist of students, scholars, and vacationers.

> **BerkeleyMew**: Hey, I'm going to defend Toronto.

>
> **anarcat**: Ohhh I didn't know that.
>
> **plasmage**: Real useful discussion you're having there.
>
> **anarcat**: Oh come on, less useful than 'slinger bitching about Dubai?

The asteroid has two major industries: Kainouda Area Independent University, together with a handful of satellite labs and think-tanks; and a system of resorts covering two-thirds of the of the "equatorial strip."

KAIU is well-regarded (meaning it maintains a solid R-rep), and boasts particularly strong industrial engineering and economics programs.
It is notable for being connected to both the Kainouda Area Research Corporation (which focuses on industrial engineering) and the Carbon Institute (an economics think-tank).
The habitat also hosts a number of other smaller think-tanks and labs, which also feed off of the pool of talent (and clientele) attracted by KAIU.

The hab also hosts a number of resorts, most laid out on the shores of a meandering series of rivers and lakes that circles the main chamber at the "equator" (or "valley floor," depending on how you want to view it).
These include the Carbon Cove, which sprawls over 230m of the equator and is modelled (loosely) on the Greek Mediterranean; the Grand Chorus Hotel, which is themed after a Cancún resort; and the Overlook, which is themed after a mountain in and located on an artificial outcropping half-way up the "slope" of the chamber.

Minor local concerns include Liu-Worth-Jacobson, a boutique ecosystem design firm contracted by both the Grand Chorus and the Carbon Cove and responsible for maintaining the carefully-divided micro-ecosystems of both hotels; a local Argonaut mirror for a number of engineering-related projects and journals, maintained in collaboration with KAIU; and Chorus Lake Defence, a microcorp that focuses on defending the habitat from external threats (which is complicated by the fact that the habitat is not permitted to deploy its own weaponry while it remains within the area covered by Kainouda 2035's defensive systems).

Notably, the locals have a conservationist bent and a long-term view; they emphasize sustainability over growth, and tend to draw lightly on their resources.

> **Apotheotician**: As much as we've all had fun watching Gunslinger really hate these people for no particular reason, it's worth noting that the Compact can be useful to Sentinels because it's a place in the Kainouda area where F-rep spends — even if that network is going to be shallow, because you're talking about a handful of resorts with about two thousand guests total.

> For what it's worth, while they're fairly high-class places, Carbon Cove and Grand Chorus aren't the kinds of places that cater to oligarchs proper.
> Rumor has it that one or two of those folks *have* come to visit, but they have smaller, off-the-books, private arrangements.

### Rapid Transit

One notable feature of the compact is an external rotating track; this track is used to provide low-reaction-mass transit to the Thistledown.
The track is aligned such that, if release is timed very precisely, it will "throw" an object to the Thistledown.
This allows travellers to get an initial "boost" of speed without spending reaction mass.
(Of course, a ship would still need to spend reaction mass to *stop* upon reaching the Thistledown.)

The track is kept in motion, because accelerating it and decelerating would require energy; it typically rotates with an angular velocity of 40m/s (which means that someone hanging off of it would experience 0.52 centrigrav).
The track can be adjusted, should either more "free" acceleration or less subjective centrigrav be desired, although this is rare, because the energy requirements to speed it up or slow it down are significant.
With just the free boost from the track, the 500km journey to the Thistledown would take about three and a half hours.
