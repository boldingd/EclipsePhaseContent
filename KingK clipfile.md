The only thing anarchists hate more than hierarchies is other types of anarchists.

I've always tended to agree with Clarence Swartz on the matter: "One of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of one's labor.".

I'm not surprised, law enforcement has always been something of an elephant in the room for establishing a functional anarachist society.

As someone with pretty heavy anarchist leanings who's ostensibly involved in a law enforcement agency I don't think that some sort of centralized agency to ensure public safety is antithetical to the abolition of hierarchy. Non-hierarchical does not mean non-centralized.

The main concern is accountability - A law enforcement agency needs to be accountable to the people it's protecting or it's just another tool of opression.

A lot of these utopianist types are also prone to underplaying or ignoring fairly serious practical issues if it means questioning some of the baseline assumptions of your own ideology. To them Locus needs to be a utopia not as a benefit to the inhabitants, but to show that their ideology is correct. If something on Locus isn't working a lot of the inhabitants are inclined to pretend the problem doesn't exist, as acknowledging it would mean admitting fault in their ideology.

An important thing to remember is that opprssion can still exist without hierarchies: If you have have a hab primarily populated by racists then their society is going to be oppressive whether it's hierarchical or not.

If we can't discuss extant societies without it devolving into ideological posturing I'm going to turn this chat around and there'll be no Locus discussion for anyone.

==A NOTE ON LANGUAGE==

This explains the uptic of Quebecois idioms I've been seeing on the @-net. And here I thought I'd just made that much of an impact...
[question about her being Quebecois]
Ontario French, technically speaking. They're functionally near-identical, but don't tell any of the boys from Montreal I said that...

It's honestly amazing how deeply the languages of our youth stick with us - I've been speaking Barsoomian for more than a decade and people still comment on how much of my  Canadian French influence bleeds through into the way I speak it.

==ECONOMY, CAPITAL AND FABBING==
Keep in mind that social norms and rules come from circumstance - I'd personally balk if my community tried to implement these sort of restrictions on weapon fabrication, but that's because we live within spitting distance of the TQZ and have good reason to arm ourselves. On a self-contained and stable hab like this there's much less need for your average civilian to be armed.
